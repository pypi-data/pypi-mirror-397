              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

![Dedoc](https://github.com/ispras/dedoc/raw/master/dedoc_logo.png)

Dedoc is an open universal system for converting documents to a unified output format. 
It extracts a document’s logical structure and content: tables, text formatting and metadata. 
The document’s content is represented as a tree storing headings and lists of any level. 
Dedoc can be integrated in a document contents and structure analysis system as a separate module.

## Workflow
![Workflow](https://github.com/ispras/dedoc/raw/master/docs/source/_static/workflow.png)

Workflow description is given [`here`](https://dedoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest#workflow)

## Features and advantages
Dedoc is implemented in Python and works with semi-structured data formats (DOC/DOCX, ODT, XLS/XLSX, CSV, TXT, JSON) and unstructured data formats like images (PNG, JPG etc.), archives (ZIP, RAR etc.), PDF and HTML formats. 
Document structure extraction is fully automatic regardless of input data type. 
Metadata and text formatting are also extracted automatically. 

In 2022, the system won a grant to support the development of promising AI projects from the [Innovation Assistance Foundation (Фонд содействия инновациям)](https://fasie.ru/).

## Dedoc provides:
* Extensibility due to flexible addition of new document formats and easy change of an output data format. 
* Support for extracting document structure out of nested documents having different formats. 
* Extracting various text formatting features (indentation, font type, size, style etc.). 
* Working with documents of various origin (statements of work, legal documents, technical reports, scientific papers) allowing flexible tuning for new domains. 
* Working with PDF documents containing a textual layer:
  * Support to automatically determine the correctness of the textual layer in PDF documents; 
  * Extract containing and formatting from PDF-documents with a textual layer using the developed interpreter of the virtual stack machine for printing graphics according to the format specification. 
* Extracting table data from DOC/DOCX, PDF, HTML, CSV and image formats:
  * Recognizing a physical structure and a cell text for complex multipage tables having explicit borders with the help of contour analysis. 
* Working with scanned documents (image formats and PDF without text layer):
  * Using Tesseract, an actively developed OCR engine from Google, together with image preprocessing methods. 
  * Utilizing modern machine learning approaches for detecting a document orientation, detecting single/multicolumn document page, detecting bold text and extracting hierarchical structure based on the classification of features extracted from document images.

## Document format description
The system processes different document formats. The main formats are listed below:

| PDF, document images | Copyable PDF documents (with a textual layer) can be handled using [pdfminer-six](https://pdfminersix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library or [tabby](https://github.com/sunveil/ispras_tbl_extr) software. Non-copyable PDF documents or images are handled using [Tesseract-OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), machine learning methods (including neural network methods) and [image processing methods](https://opencv.org/) |

## Examples of processed scanned documents
* Dedoc can only process scanned black and white documents, such as technical specifications, regulations, articles, etc.

* In particular, dedoc recognizes tabular information only from tables with explicit boundaries. Here are examples of documents that can be processed by an dedoc's image handler:

* The system also automatically detects and corrects the orientation of scanned documents

## Impact
This project may be useful as a first step of an automatic document analysis pipeline (e.g. before the NLP part).
Dedoc is in demand for information analytic systems, information leak monitoring systems, as well as for natural language processing systems.
The library is intended for application use by developers of systems for automatic analysis and structuring of electronic documents, including for further search in electronic documents.

# Installation instructions

This project has a REST api and you can run it in Docker container.
Also, dedoc can be installed as a library via `pip`.
There are two ways to install and run dedoc as a web application or a library that are described below.


## Install and run dedoc using docker 

You should have [`git`](https://git-scm.com) and [`docker`](https://www.docker.com) installed for running dedoc by this method.
This method is more flexible because it doesn't depend on the operating system and other user's limitations,
still, the docker application should be installed and configured properly.

If you don't need to change the application configuration, you may use the built docker image as well.

## Work with dedoc as service

### 1. Pull the image
```shell
docker pull dedocproject/dedoc
```

### 2. Run the container
```shell
docker run -p 1231:1231 --rm dedocproject/dedoc python3 /dedoc_root/dedoc/main.py
```

Go to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dedocproject/dedoc) to get more information about available dedoc images.

If you need to change some application settings, you may update `config.py` according to your needs and re-build the image. 
You can build and run image:

### 1. Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ispras/dedoc
```

### 2. Go to the `dedoc` directory
```shell
cd dedoc
```

### 3. Build the image and run the application
```shell
docker compose up --build
```

### 4. Run container with tests
```shell
test="true" docker compose up --build
```

If you need to change some application settings, you may update `config.py` according to your needs and re-build the image.


## Install dedoc using pip

If you don't want to use docker for running the application, it's possible to run dedoc locally.
However, it isn't suitable for any operating system (`Ubuntu 20+` is recommended) and
there may be not enough machine resources for its work.
You should have `python` (`python3.9`, `python3.10` are recommended) and `pip` installed.
Installation instructions via pip are available [here](https://dedoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html#install-dedoc-using-pip).

## Install and run dedoc from sources
You can also install and run dedoc locally from sources using [this](https://dedoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html#install-and-run-dedoc-from-sources) instruction.
