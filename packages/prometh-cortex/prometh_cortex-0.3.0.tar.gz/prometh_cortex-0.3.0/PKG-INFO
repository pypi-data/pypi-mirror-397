              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

## Overview

Prometh Cortex is a local-first, extensible system for indexing multiple datalake repositories containing Markdown files and exposing their content for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows through a local MCP (Modular Command Processor) server.

## Features

- **Multi-Datalake Support**: Index multiple repositories of Markdown documents
- **YAML Frontmatter Parsing**: Rich metadata extraction with structured schema support
- **Dual Vector Store Support**: Choose between local FAISS or cloud-native Qdrant
- **Incremental Indexing**: Smart change detection for efficient updates
- **MCP Server**: Local server compatible with Claude, VSCode, and other tools
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command line tools for indexing and querying
- **Performance Optimized**: Target <100ms query response time on M1/M2 Mac

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install prometh-cortex
```

### From Source (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivannagy/prometh-cortex.git
cd prometh-cortex
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

1. **Install via pip**:
```bash
pip install prometh-cortex
```

2. **Initialize configuration** (creates `~/.config/prometh-cortex/config.toml`):
```bash
pcortex config --init
```

3. **Edit your config file**:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
nano ~/.config/prometh-cortex/config.toml

# Or use your preferred editor
# Update the [datalake] repos with your document paths
```

4. **Build index**:
```bash
pcortex build
```

5. **Query locally**:
```bash
pcortex query "search for something"
```

6. **Start servers**:
```bash
# For Claude Desktop (MCP protocol)
pcortex mcp

# For Perplexity/VSCode/HTTP integrations
pcortex serve
```

### Configuration File Locations

Prometh-cortex follows the XDG Base Directory Specification. Config files are searched in this order:

1. `./config.toml` - Current directory (highest priority)
2. `~/.config/prometh-cortex/config.toml` - XDG config directory (recommended)
3. `~/.prometh-cortex/config.toml` - Fallback location

**Useful commands**:
```bash
# Initialize config in XDG directory (recommended for system-wide use)
pcortex config --init

# Create sample config in current directory (for project-specific config)
pcortex config --sample

# Show all config search paths
pcortex config --show-paths
```

## Configuration

Create a `config.toml` file with your settings:

```bash
cp config.toml.sample config.toml
# Edit config.toml with your specific paths and settings
```

### Configuration Format (TOML) - v0.3.0

Prometh Cortex v0.3.0 uses a **unified collection with per-source chunking** architecture. A single FAISS/Qdrant index contains all documents, with each source defining its own chunk parameters.

```toml
[datalake]
# Add your document directories here
repos = [
    "/path/to/your/notes",
    "/path/to/your/documents",
    "/path/to/your/projects"
]

[storage]
rag_index_dir = "/path/to/index/storage"

[server]
port = 8080
host = "localhost"
auth_token = "your-secure-token"

[embedding]
model = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
max_query_results = 10

# Single unified collection
[[collections]]
name = "prometh_cortex"

# Multiple sources with per-source chunking parameters
[[sources]]
name = "knowledge_base"
chunk_size = 768
chunk_overlap = 76
source_patterns = ["docs/specs", "docs/prds"]

[[sources]]
name = "meetings"
chunk_size = 512
chunk_overlap = 51
source_patterns = ["meetings"]

[[sources]]
name = "todos"
chunk_size = 256
chunk_overlap = 26
source_patterns = ["todos", "reminders"]

[[sources]]
name = "default"
chunk_size = 512
chunk_overlap = 50
source_patterns = ["*"]  # Catch-all for unmatched documents

[vector_store]
type = "faiss"  # or "qdrant"

# Qdrant configuration (when type = "qdrant")
[vector_store.qdrant]
host = "localhost"
port = 6333
collection_name = "prometh_cortex"
```

**Key Changes in v0.3.0**:
- ✅ Single `[[collections]]` section (previously multiple)
- ✅ Multiple `[[sources]]` sections with chunking parameters
- ✅ Documents routed to sources by pattern matching
- ✅ Single unified FAISS/Qdrant index (vs multiple per v0.2.0)
- ✅ 40-63% faster queries (~300ms vs ~500ms)

## Vector Store Configuration

Prometh Cortex supports two vector store backends:

### Option 1: FAISS (Default - Local Storage)

**Best for**: Local development, private deployments, no external dependencies

```toml
[vector_store]
type = "faiss"

[storage]
rag_index_dir = ".rag_index"
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Fast local queries
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Simple setup

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Limited to single machine
- ❌ No concurrent write access
- ❌ Manual backup required

### Option 2: Qdrant (Cloud-native Vector Database)

**Best for**: Production deployments, team collaboration, scalable solutions

#### Local Qdrant with Docker

```bash
# Start Qdrant container with persistent storage
docker run -d \
  --name qdrant \
  -p 6333:6333 \
  -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage \
  qdrant/qdrant

[vector_store]
type = "qdrant"

[vector_store.qdrant]
host = "localhost"
port = 6333
collection_name = "prometh_cortex"
```

#### Cloud Qdrant

```bash
[vector_store]
type = "qdrant"

[vector_store.qdrant]
host = "your-cluster.qdrant.io"
port = 6333
collection_name = "prometh_cortex"
api_key = "your-api-key-here"
use_https = true
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Concurrent access support
- ✅ Built-in clustering and replication
- ✅ Advanced filtering capabilities
- ✅ REST API access
- ✅ Automatic backups (cloud)
- ✅ Horizontal scaling

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Requires external service
- ❌ Network dependency
- ❌ Additional complexity

#### Qdrant Setup Steps

1. **Local Docker Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create persistent storage directory
   mkdir -p qdrant_storage
   
   # Start Qdrant container
   docker run -d \
     --name qdrant \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     -p 6333:6333 \
     -p 6334:6334 \
     -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage \
     qdrant/qdrant
   
   # Verify Qdrant is running
   curl http://localhost:6333/health
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
# Add to your config.toml:
[vector_store]
type = "qdrant"

[vector_store.qdrant]
host = "localhost"
port = 6333
collection_name = "prometh_cortex"
# api_key = ""  # Optional for local Docker  
# use_https = false  # Default for local
   ```

3. **Build Index**:
   ```bash
   # Initial build or incremental update
   pcortex build
   
   # Force complete rebuild
   pcortex rebuild --confirm
   ```

4. **Verify Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Check health and statistics
   pcortex query "test" --max-results 1
   
   # Or directly check Qdrant
   curl http://localhost:6333/collections/prometh_cortex
   ```

#### Qdrant Cloud Setup

1. **Create Qdrant Cloud Account**:
   - Visit [Qdrant Cloud](https://qdrant.io/cloud/)
   - Create a cluster and get your credentials

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
# Add to your config.toml:
[vector_store]
type = "qdrant"

[vector_store.qdrant]
host = "your-cluster-id.qdrant.io"
port = 6333
collection_name = "prometh_cortex"
api_key = "your-api-key"
use_https = true
   ```

#### Migration Between Vector Stores

```bash
# Backup current index (if using FAISS)
pcortex build --backup /tmp/backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Change vector store type in config.toml
sed -i 's/type = "faiss"/type = "qdrant"/' config.toml

# Rebuild index with new vector store
pcortex rebuild --confirm

# Verify migration successful
pcortex query "test migration" --max-results 1
```

## CLI Commands

### Build Index
```bash
# Initial build (automatic incremental updates)
pcortex build

# Force complete rebuild (ignores incremental changes)
pcortex build --force

# Disable incremental indexing
pcortex build --no-incremental

# Rebuild entire index (with confirmation)
pcortex rebuild
pcortex rebuild --confirm  # Skip confirmation prompt
```

### Query Index (Unified Collection with Optional Source Filtering)
```bash
# Query across all sources in unified collection
pcortex query "search term"

# Query with source filtering (optional)
pcortex query "meeting notes" --source meetings
pcortex query "action items" -s todos

# Query with options
pcortex query "search term" --max-results 5 --show-content
```

### List Sources (v0.3.0+)
```bash
# List all configured sources with statistics
pcortex sources

# Verbose output with chunk configuration details
pcortex sources -v
```

### Start Servers

#### MCP Server (for Claude Desktop)
```bash
# Start MCP server with stdio protocol
pcortex mcp
```

#### HTTP Server (for web integrations)
```bash
# Start HTTP server (default: localhost:8080)
pcortex serve

# Custom host/port
pcortex serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000

## Supported YAML Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
---
title: Document Title
created: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
author: Author Name
category: #Category
tags:
  - #tag1
  - tag2
focus: Work
uuid: document-uuid
project:
  - name: Project Name
    uuid: project-uuid            # UUID preserved for document linking
reminder:
  - subject: Reminder Text
    uuid: reminder-uuid           # UUID preserved for document linking
    list: List Name
event:
  subject: Event Subject
  uuid: event-uuid                # UUID preserved for document linking
  shortUUID: MF042576B            # Short UUID also preserved
  organizer: Organizer Name
  attendees:
    - Attendee 1
    - Attendee 2
  location: Event Location
  start: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS      # Event start time
  end: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS        # Event end time
related:
  - Related Item 1
  - Related Item 2
---
```

**Note on UUIDs for Document Linking:**
- Project, reminder, and event UUIDs are **preserved** in vector store metadata
- These UUIDs enable cross-document linking and relationship queries
- Use these UUIDs to find related documents across your datalake
- Query by UUID: `event_uuid:B897515C-1BE9-41B6-8423-3988BE0C9E3E`

### YAML Frontmatter Best Practices

**⚠️ Important**: When using special characters in YAML values, always quote them properly to ensure correct parsing:

#### ✅ Correct Usage:
```yaml
---
title: "[PRJ-0119] Add New Feature"    # Quoted because of brackets
author: "John O'Connor"                # Quoted because of apostrophe
tags:
  - "C#"                               # Quoted because of hash symbol
  - "project-2024"                     # Safe without quotes
category: "Work & Personal"            # Quoted because of ampersand
---
```

#### ❌ Problematic Usage:
```yaml
---
title: [PRJ-0119] Add New Feature      # Brackets will cause parsing errors
author: John O'Connor                  # Apostrophe may cause issues
tags:
  - C#                                 # Hash symbol conflicts with YAML
category: Work & Personal              # Ampersand may cause issues  
---
```

#### Common Characters That Need Quoting:
- **Square brackets** `[]`: `title: "[PROJECT-123] Task Name"`
- **Curly braces** `{}`: `status: "{COMPLETED}"`
- **Hash/Pound** `#`: `tag: "C#"`
- **Colon** `:`: `note: "Time: 3:30 PM"`
- **Ampersand** `&`: `title: "Sales & Marketing"`
- **Asterisk** `*`: `priority: "*HIGH*"`
- **Pipe** `|`: `command: "grep | sort"`
- **Greater/Less than** `<>`: `comparison: "<100ms"`
- **At symbol** `@`: `email: "@company.com"`
- **Apostrophes** `'`: `name: "O'Connor"`

#### Why This Matters:
- **Metadata Parsing**: Improper YAML syntax prevents frontmatter from being extracted
- **Index Quality**: Missing metadata means poor search results and filtering
- **Qdrant Storage**: Malformed YAML leads to incomplete document payloads
- **Search Performance**: Documents without proper metadata are harder to find

#### Validation:
Test your YAML frontmatter before indexing:
```bash
# Quick validation of a document
python -c "
import yaml
import frontmatter

with open('your-document.md', 'r') as f:
    post = frontmatter.load(f)
    print('✅ YAML parsed successfully')
    print(f'Title: {post.metadata.get(\"title\", \"N/A\")}')
    print(f'Fields: {list(post.metadata.keys())}')
"
```

## Integration

### Claude Desktop Integration

Configure Claude Desktop by editing `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prometh-cortex": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/project/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "-m", "prometh_cortex.cli.main", "mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DATALAKE_REPOS": "/path/to/your/notes,/path/to/your/documents,/path/to/your/projects",
        "RAG_INDEX_DIR": "/path/to/index/storage",
        "MCP_PORT": "8080",
        "MCP_HOST": "localhost",
        "MCP_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-secure-token",
        "EMBEDDING_MODEL": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
        "MAX_QUERY_RESULTS": "10",
        "CHUNK_SIZE": "512",
        "CHUNK_OVERLAP": "50",
        "VECTOR_STORE_TYPE": "faiss"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Setup Steps**:

1. **Install in Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/prometh-cortex
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Configure Settings**: Create and customize your configuration:
   ```bash
   # Create configuration file
   cp config.toml.sample config.toml
   
   # Edit config.toml with your specific paths and settings
   # Update the [datalake] repos array with your document directories
   # Set your preferred [storage] rag_index_dir location
   # Customize [server] auth_token for security
   ```

3. **Build your index**:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pcortex build --force
   ```

4. **Get Absolute Paths**: Update the MCP configuration with your actual paths:
   ```bash
   # Get your virtual environment Python path
   which python  # While .venv is activated
   
   # Get your project directory
   pwd
   ```

5. **Update Claude Desktop Config**: Use absolute paths in your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "prometh-cortex": {
         "command": "/path/to/your/project/.venv/bin/python",
         "args": [
           "-m", "prometh_cortex.cli.main", "mcp"
         ],
         "env": {
           "DATALAKE_REPOS": "/path/to/your/notes,/path/to/your/documents,/path/to/your/projects",
           "RAG_INDEX_DIR": "/path/to/index/storage",
           "MCP_PORT": "8080",
           "MCP_HOST": "localhost",
           "MCP_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-secure-token",
           "EMBEDDING_MODEL": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
           "MAX_QUERY_RESULTS": "10",
           "CHUNK_SIZE": "512",
           "CHUNK_OVERLAP": "50"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Verify Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Test MCP server manually
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pcortex mcp  # Should start without errors
   ```

7. **Restart Claude Desktop**: Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop application.

**Troubleshooting**:
- ✅ **Check Logs**: Look at Claude Desktop console logs for MCP connection errors
- ✅ **Verify Paths**: Ensure all paths in the config are absolute and correct
- ✅ **Test Index**: Run `pcortex query "test"` to verify your index works
- ✅ **Environment**: Make sure environment variables are accessible from the MCP context

**Usage**: After restarting Claude Desktop, you'll have access to these MCP tools:
- **prometh_cortex_query**: Search your indexed documents
  - Ask: "Search my notes for yesterday's meetings"
  - Ask: "Find documents about project planning" 
  - Ask: "What meetings did I have last week?"
- **prometh_cortex_health**: Check system status
  - Ask: "How many documents are indexed in prometh-cortex?"
  - Ask: "What's the health status of my knowledge base?"

### Claude.ai Web Integration

Configure Claude.ai to use your MCP server by adding it as a custom integration:

1. Start your MCP server: `pcortex serve`
2. Use the webhook URL: `http://localhost:8080/prometh_cortex_query`
3. Set authentication header: `Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token`
4. Send queries in JSON format:
   ```json
   {
     "query": "search term",
     "max_results": 10
   }
   ```

### Perplexity Integration

Configure Perplexity to use your local MCP server for document search:

**Prerequisites**:
1. **Start HTTP Server** (not MCP protocol):
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pcortex serve --port 8001  # Use different port than MCP
   ```

2. **Configure for Performance** (important for Perplexity timeouts):
   ```bash
# Edit your config.toml for faster responses
# In the [embedding] section, set:
# max_query_results = 3  # Reduce from default 10 to 3
   ```

3. **Verify Health**:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token" \
        http://localhost:8001/prometh_cortex_health
   ```

**Integration Setup**:
1. **Server Configuration**:
   - Protocol: `HTTP`
   - URL: `http://localhost:8001/prometh_cortex_query`
   - Method: `POST`
   - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token`
   - Content-Type: `application/json`

2. **Query Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "query": "your search query",
     "max_results": 3
   }
   ```

3. **Example Request**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/prometh_cortex_query \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "meeting notes", "max_results": 3}'
   ```

**Performance Optimization**:
- ✅ **Reduced Results**: Use `max_results: 3` instead of 10 to avoid timeouts
- ✅ **Dedicated Port**: Use separate port (8001) for Perplexity vs other integrations
- ✅ **Quick Queries**: Response time optimized to <400ms for timeout compatibility

**Usage in Perplexity**: 
- Ask: "Search my local documents for project updates"
- Ask: "Find my notes about last week's meetings"
- Ask: "What information do I have about [specific topic]?"

### VSCode with GitHub Copilot Integration

Configure VSCode to use your MCP server with GitHub Copilot:

#### Option 1: VSCode MCP Extension (Recommended)

1. **Install MCP for VSCode**:
   ```bash
   # Install the VSCode MCP extension
   code --install-extension ms-vscode.mcp
   ```

2. **Configure MCP Settings**: Add to your VSCode `settings.json` or create `.vscode/mcp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "prometh-cortex": {
         "command": "/path/to/your/project/.venv/bin/python",
         "args": [
           "-m", "prometh_cortex.cli.main", "mcp"
         ],
         "env": {
           "DATALAKE_REPOS": "/path/to/your/notes,/path/to/your/documents,/path/to/your/projects",
           "RAG_INDEX_DIR": "/path/to/index/storage",
           "MCP_PORT": "8080",
           "MCP_HOST": "localhost",
           "MCP_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-secure-token",
           "EMBEDDING_MODEL": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
           "MAX_QUERY_RESULTS": "10",
           "CHUNK_SIZE": "512",
           "CHUNK_OVERLAP": "50"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Update User Settings**: Add to your VSCode `settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcp.servers": {
       "prometh-cortex": {
         "enabled": true
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Verify Integration**:
   - Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Run "MCP: List Servers" 
   - You should see "prometh-cortex" listed and active

#### Option 2: Direct HTTP Integration

Add to your VSCode `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "github.copilot.advanced": {
    "debug.useElectronPrompts": true,
    "debug.useNodeUserForPrompts": true
  },
  "prometh-cortex.server.url": "http://localhost:8001",
  "prometh-cortex.server.token": "your-secret-token"
}
```

Start the HTTP server:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pcortex serve --port 8001
```

#### Option 3: Custom Task Integration

Create `.vscode/tasks.json` for quick queries:
```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Query Prometh-Cortex",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "curl",
      "args": [
        "-H", "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token",
        "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",
        "-d", "{\"query\": \"${input:searchQuery}\", \"max_results\": 5}",
        "http://localhost:8001/prometh_cortex_query"
      ],
      "group": "build",
      "presentation": {
        "echo": true,
        "reveal": "always",
        "panel": "new"
      }
    }
  ],
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "searchQuery",
      "description": "Enter your search query",
      "default": "meeting notes",
      "type": "promptString"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Setup Steps**:
1. **Build Index**: Ensure your RAG index is built and up-to-date
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pcortex build --force
   ```

2. **Start MCP Server** (for Option 1):
   ```bash
   # MCP server runs automatically when VSCode starts
   # Check VSCode Output panel for MCP logs
   ```

3. **Start HTTP Server** (for Options 2-3):
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pcortex serve --port 8001
   ```

**Usage**:
- **Option 1**: Use MCP commands directly in GitHub Copilot chat
  - Ask: "Search my documents for project planning notes"
  - Ask: "Find my meeting notes from last week"
- **Option 2**: GitHub Copilot will automatically query your local documents
- **Option 3**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Query Prometh-Cortex"

**Troubleshooting**:
- ✅ **Check MCP Output**: View "Output" panel in VSCode, select "MCP" from dropdown
- ✅ **Verify Paths**: Ensure all paths are absolute and accessible
- ✅ **Test Manually**: Run `pcortex mcp` or `pcortex serve` to verify functionality
- ✅ **Restart VSCode**: After configuration changes, restart VSCode completely
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "searchQuery",
      "description": "Enter your search query",
      "default": "meeting notes",
      "type": "promptString"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Usage**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Query Prometh-Cortex"

### General MCP Configuration Guide

**Two Server Types Available**:

1. **MCP Protocol Server** (`pcortex mcp`):
   - **Purpose**: AI assistant integration (Claude Desktop, VSCode MCP)
   - **Protocol**: stdio-based MCP
   - **Port**: No network port (stdio communication)
   - **Usage**: Direct integration with MCP-compatible clients

2. **HTTP REST Server** (`pcortex serve`):
   - **Purpose**: Web applications, HTTP clients (Perplexity, custom integrations)
   - **Protocol**: HTTP REST API
   - **Port**: Configurable (default: 8080)
   - **Usage**: Traditional HTTP API access

**Configuration Prerequisites**: 

1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   
   # Install in development mode
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Create Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Create configuration from sample
   cp config.toml.sample config.toml
   # Edit config.toml with your specific settings
   ```

3. **Build Index**:
   ```bash
   pcortex build --force
   ```

4. **Test Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Test MCP server
   pcortex mcp  # Should start without errors, Ctrl+C to stop
   
   # Test HTTP server
   pcortex serve  # Should show server info, Ctrl+C to stop
   
   # Test query functionality
   pcortex query "test search"
   ```

**Common Integration Pattern**:

For **HTTP integrations** (Perplexity, web apps):
```bash
# Start HTTP server
pcortex serve --port 8001

# Query endpoint
POST http://localhost:8001/prometh_cortex_query
Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "your search query",
  "max_results": 10,
  "filters": {
    "datalake": "notes",
    "tags": ["work"]
  }
}

# Health check
GET http://localhost:8001/prometh_cortex_health
Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token
```

For **MCP integrations** (Claude Desktop, VSCode):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prometh-cortex": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/project/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "-m", "prometh_cortex.cli.main", "mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DATALAKE_REPOS": "/path/to/your/notes,/path/to/your/documents,/path/to/your/projects",
        "RAG_INDEX_DIR": "/path/to/index/storage",
        "MCP_PORT": "8080",
        "MCP_HOST": "localhost",
        "MCP_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-secure-token",
        "EMBEDDING_MODEL": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
        "MAX_QUERY_RESULTS": "10",
        "CHUNK_SIZE": "512",
        "CHUNK_OVERLAP": "50",
        "VECTOR_STORE_TYPE": "faiss"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Performance Tuning**:
- **For Perplexity**: Set `max_query_results = 3` in config.toml to avoid timeouts
- **For Development**: Use `--reload` flag with `pcortex serve`
- **For Production**: Use production WSGI server instead of development server

**Auto-start Script**:
Create `start_servers.sh` for easy management:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Kill existing servers
pkill -f "pcortex serve" 2>/dev/null || true
pkill -f "pcortex mcp" 2>/dev/null || true

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Start HTTP server in background
nohup pcortex serve --port 8001 > /tmp/prometh-cortex-http.log 2>&1 &

echo "Prometh-Cortex servers started"
echo "HTTP Server: http://localhost:8001"
echo "MCP Server: Available for stdio connections"
echo "Logs: /tmp/prometh-cortex-http.log"
```

**Troubleshooting Checklist**:
- ✅ **Virtual Environment**: Always use absolute paths to `.venv/bin/python`
- ✅ **Configuration**: Set `datalake.repos` and `storage.rag_index_dir` in config.toml 
- ✅ **Index Built**: Run `pcortex build` before using servers
- ✅ **Ports Available**: Check port conflicts with `lsof -i :8080`
- ✅ **Logs Check**: Monitor server logs for configuration errors
- ✅ **Path Permissions**: Ensure read access to datalake and write access to index directory

## Documentation

**Architecture & Design**:
- **[Unified Collection Spec (v0.3.0+)](docs/specs/feature-unified-collection-per-source-chunking-spec.md)** - Complete technical specification for unified collection with per-source chunking architecture
- **[Multi-Collection Spec (v0.2.0 - Deprecated)](docs/specs/feature-rag-multi-collection-indexing-spec.md)** - Legacy multi-collection architecture (archived for reference)

**Migration Guides**:
- **[v0.2.0 → v0.3.0 Migration Guide](docs/migration-v0.2-to-v0.3.md)** - Step-by-step guide for migrating from multi-collection to unified collection
- **[v0.1.x → v0.2.0 Migration Guide](docs/migration-v0.1-to-v0.2.md)** - Historical migration guide (archived)

**Key Improvements in v0.3.0**:
- **Unified Collection**: Single FAISS/Qdrant index instead of multiple
- **Per-Source Chunking**: Different chunk sizes per document source in unified index
- **Topic-Based Queries**: Query across document types naturally
- **Better Performance**: ~300ms queries (vs ~500ms multi-collection)
- **Lower Memory**: Single index (vs 3-5x for multi-collection)
