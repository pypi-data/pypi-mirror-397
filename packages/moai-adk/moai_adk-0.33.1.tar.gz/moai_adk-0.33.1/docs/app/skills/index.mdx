# MoAI-ADK Skills Library

The MoAI-ADK Skills Library provides 22 specialized skills that power Alfred's capabilities across different domains. Each skill represents a focused area of expertise, from programming languages and frameworks to design systems and quality assurance.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are reusable knowledge modules that Alfred can load to enhance his capabilities in specific domains. They provide:

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information organized from quick reference to advanced implementation
- **Context-Aware Loading**: Auto-loaded based on task requirements
- **Domain Expertise**: Specialized knowledge in specific technologies or patterns
- **Best Practices**: Curated patterns and anti-patterns

## How Skills Work

### Auto-Loading Strategy

Alfred automatically loads skills based on context:

```python
# Zero tokens (Quick Reference) - Simple tasks
- File reading
- Basic questions
- Simple modifications

# 8,470 tokens (Auto-load) - Complex tasks
- Command execution (/moai:* commands)
- Agent delegation (Task() calls)
- SPEC analysis
- Architectural decisions
- Complexity ≥ medium
```

### Conditional Loading

Skills are conditionally loaded when:

1. **Command Execution**: Any `/moai:*` command
2. **Agent Delegation**: Calling `Task()` for specialized agents
3. **SPEC Involvement**: SPEC analysis, creation, validation
4. **Architecture Decisions**: System/API/database/security design
5. **Medium+ Complexity**: 3+ of these criteria:
   - Files to modify: 3+
   - Architecture impact: Medium or High
   - Implementation time: 1+ hours
   - Feature integration: Multiple layers
   - Maintenance need: Ongoing

### Skill Composition

Skills work together to solve complex problems:

```python
# Backend API Development
Skill("moai-foundation-core")        # SPEC-First TDD
Skill("moai-lang-unified")           # Python/TypeScript
Skill("moai-platform-baas")          # Supabase integration

# Frontend UI Implementation
Skill("moai-foundation-uiux")        # Design systems
Skill("moai-lang-unified")           # TypeScript/React
Skill("moai-library-shadcn")         # Component library

# Documentation Generation
Skill("moai-library-nextra")         # Documentation framework
Skill("moai-workflow-docs")          # Validation & generation
Skill("moai-library-mermaid")        # Diagram creation

# E2E Testing
Skill("moai-lang-unified")           # TypeScript
Skill("moai-workflow-testing")       # Playwright orchestration
Skill("moai-foundation-quality")     # Quality gates
```

## Progressive Disclosure Architecture

Each skill follows a consistent structure:

### Quick Reference (30 seconds)
Core capabilities, key features, when to use

### Implementation Guide (5 minutes)
- Features and capabilities
- When to use this skill
- Core patterns (3 examples)

### Core Patterns (10+ minutes)
- Pattern 1-5: Detailed implementation patterns
- Real-world code examples
- Best practices

### Advanced Documentation (Reference)
- Detailed modules and references
- API documentation
- Integration guides

### Works Well With
- Related agents
- Complementary skills
- Relevant commands

## Token Efficiency

Skills are designed for token efficiency:

| Task Complexity | Loading Strategy | Token Cost | Percentage of Tasks |
|-----------------|------------------|------------|---------------------|
| Simple | Quick Reference Only | 0 tokens | 60% |
| Complex | Auto-load Skill | ~8,470 tokens | 40% |
| **Average** | **Conditional** | **~3,400 tokens** | **100%** |

**Savings**: ~5,000 tokens per session vs. loading all skills upfront.

## Best Practices

### DO
✅ Let Alfred auto-load skills based on context
✅ Reference skills explicitly when needed: `Skill("moai-foundation-core")`
✅ Combine multiple skills for complex tasks
✅ Use Quick Reference sections for fast lookups

### DON'T
❌ Manually load all skills at once (wastes tokens)
❌ Ignore skill recommendations from Alfred
❌ Use skills outside their intended domain
❌ Bypass skill architecture by direct implementation
