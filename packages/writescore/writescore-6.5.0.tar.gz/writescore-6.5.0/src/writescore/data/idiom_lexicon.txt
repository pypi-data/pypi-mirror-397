break the ice
piece of cake
kick the bucket
cost an arm and a leg
let the cat out of the bag
under the weather
once in a blue moon
hit the sack
miss the boat
on cloud nine
break a leg
cry over spilt milk
birds of a feather flock together
actions speak louder than words
back to square one
bite the bullet
burn the midnight oil
caught between a rock and a hard place
cut corners
speak of the devil
see eye to eye
put all your eggs in one basket
the ball is in your court
get out of hand
let sleeping dogs lie
call it a day
best of both worlds
when pigs fly
pull someone's leg
sit on the fence
take it with a grain of salt
devil's advocate
hit the nail on the head
jump the gun
go back to the drawing board
in hot water
leave no stone unturned
play it by ear
throw in the towel
a dime a dozen
burn bridges
cut to the chase
by the skin of your teeth
add fuel to the fire
don't count your chickens before they hatch
every cloud has a silver lining
go the extra mile
ignorance is bliss
let someone off the hook
once bitten, twice shy
a blessing in disguise
bite off more than you can chew
on the ball
your guess is as good as mine
throw caution to the wind
take the bull by the horns
the elephant in the room
the last straw
cut somebody some slack
break the bank
call the shots
down to earth
easy does it
get cold feet
go down in flames
jump on the bandwagon
keep your chin up
keep your fingers crossed
let the chips fall where they may
not playing with a full deck
off the hook
on thin ice
out of the blue
rain on someone's parade
roll with the punches
skeleton in the closet
steal someone's thunder
take it or leave it
the early bird catches the worm
third time's the charm
under your nose
up in the air
walk on eggshells
word of mouth
you can't judge a book by its cover
a bitter pill to swallow
a drop in the ocean
behind closed doors
hit the ground running
let bygones be bygones
lose your touch
out of the frying pan and into the fire
put your foot in your mouth
touch wood
up the creek without a paddle
zero tolerance
at the end of the day
game changer
tip of the iceberg
ballpark figure
