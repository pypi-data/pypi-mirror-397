# Changelog

All notable changes to SuperGemini will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [4.2.1] - 2025-09-29

### Changed
- Bumped all framework version metadata (Python, npm, docs, setup components) to v4.2.1 for coordinated release packaging.

### Fixed
- Refreshed publishing guide pre-release tags to 4.2.1 so alpha/beta/RC instructions match the current release line.

## [4.2.0] - 2025-09-28

### Added
- **SuperAgent MCP Integration**: SuperGemini now installs and registers `superagent:gemini` alongside the core MCP suite, enabling SuperClaude-style subagent orchestration inside Gemini CLI (`setup/components/mcp.py`, new `SuperGemini/MCP/configs/superagent.json`).
- **Command & Core Assets**: Imported the latest SuperClaude command prompts and business panel resources (BUSINESS_* docs, research config) into the Gemini-optimized TOML/markdown structure.

### Changed
- **MCP Enablement Defaults**: Magic, Serena, and MorphLLM now land in the active `mcpServers` section by default; documentation highlights API key requirements instead of disabling servers out of the box (`setup/components/mcp.py`, `Docs/User-Guide/mcp-servers.md`).
- **Documentation Refresh**: Updated README and user/reference guides to describe SuperAgent usage, the new MCP behavior, and the `--introspect` analysis flow.

### Fixed
- Improved MCP prerequisite detection across Node/npm/uv version managers to prevent false "not found" errors during installation.

### Removed
- Dropped the deprecated `SuperGemini/Core/AGENTS.md` placeholder file from the installation set.

## [4.0.9] - 2025-08-24

### Removed
- **AGENTS.md reference-only file**: Removed from installation and git tracking per v4.0.8 architecture
- **Agent file imports**: Removed @AGENTS.md from Core Framework imports in GEMINI.md

### Technical Details
- AGENTS.md excluded from component file discovery (setup/core/base.py)
- Added AGENTS.md to .gitignore and removed from git tracking
- Core component now installs 3 files instead of 4 (FLAGS.md, PRINCIPLES.md, RULES.md only)
- Agent expertise remains integrated in TOML command prompts as designed

## [4.0.8] - 2025-08-24

### Fixed
- **Serena folder auto-creation**: Removed unnecessary directory creation during MCP installation
- **Logger error during uninstall**: Fixed custom Logger wrapper attribute access issue preventing clean uninstall
- **Uninstall completeness**: Enhanced file removal process with proper log handler cleanup

### Technical Details
- MCP component no longer creates serena directory unnecessarily (setup/components/mcp.py)
- Uninstall command properly accesses internal logger handlers through wrapper (setup/cli/commands/uninstall.py)
- Both issues identified and resolved through root cause analysis
