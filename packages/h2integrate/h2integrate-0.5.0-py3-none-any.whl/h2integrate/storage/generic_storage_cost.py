        cost_year (int): dollar year corresponding to input costs
        max_capacity (float): Maximum storage capacity (in non-rate units,
            e.g., "kW*h" if `commodity_units` is "kW").
        max_charge_rate (float): Maximum rate at which storage can be charged (in units
            per time step, e.g., "kW/time step").
        commodity_units (str): Units of the storage resource used to define the charge rate.
            max_capacity and max_charge_rate. Must have a base of Watts ('W') or grams ('g/h')
