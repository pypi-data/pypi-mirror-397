            the max_charge_rate. Defaults to True.

    """
    A controller that manages commodity flow based on demand and storage constraints.

    The `DemandOpenLoopStorageController` computes the state of charge (SOC), output flow,
    curtailment, and missed load for a commodity storage system. It uses a demand profile
    and storage parameters to determine how much of the commodity to charge, discharge,
    or curtail at each time step.

    Note: the units of the outputs are the same as the commodity units, which is typically a rate
    in H2Integrate (e.g. kg/h)

    Attributes:
        config (DemandOpenLoopStorageControllerConfig): Configuration object containing parameters
            such as commodity name, units, time steps, storage capacity, charge/discharge rates,
            efficiencies, and demand profile.

    Inputs:
        {commodity}_in (float): Input commodity flow timeseries (e.g., hydrogen production).
            - Units: Defined in `commodity_units` (e.g., "kg/h").

    Outputs:
        {commodity}_out (float): Output commodity flow timeseries after storage to meet demand.
            - Units: Defined in `commodity_units` (e.g., "kg/h").
            - Note: the may include commodity from commodity_in that was never used to charge the
                    storage system but was directly dispatched to meet demand.
        {commodity}_soc (float): State of charge (SOC) timeseries for the storage system.
            - Units: "unitless" (percentage of maximum capacity given as a ratio between 0 and 1).

        input commodity.
            - Units: Defined in `commodity_units` (e.g., "kg/h").
            - Note: curtailment in this case does not reduce what the converter produces, but
                rather the system just does not use it (throws it away) because this controller is
                specific to the storage technology and has no influence on other technologies in
                the system.
        {commodity}_unmet_demand (float): Unmet demand timeseries when demand exceeds supply.
            Same meaning as missed load.
            - Units: Defined in `commodity_units` (e.g., "kg/h").
        total_{commodity}_unmet_demand (float): Total unmet demand over the simulation period.

        is used to charge storage (subject to rate, efficiency, and SOC limits). When
