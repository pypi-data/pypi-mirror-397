    """OpenMDAO component for calculating Net Present Value (NPV)
    using the NumPy Financial.

    This component computes the NPV of a given commodity-producing plant over its
    operational lifetime, accounting for capital expenditures (CAPEX), operating
    expenditures (OPEX), refurbishment/replacement costs, and commodity revenues.

    NPV is calculated using the discount rate and plant life defined in the
    `plant_config`. By convention, investments (CAPEX, OPEX, refurbishment) are
    treated as negative cash flows, while revenues from commodity sales are
    positive. This follows the NumPy Financial convention:

    Reference:
        NumpPy Financial NPV documentation:
        https://numpy.org/numpy-financial/latest/npv.html#numpy_financial.npv

        By convention:
            - Investments or "deposits" are negative.
            - Income or "withdrawals" are positive.
            - Values typically start with the initial investment, so
              ``values[0]`` is often negative.

    Attributes:
        NPV_str (str): The dynamically generated name of the NPV output variable,
            based on `commodity_type` and optional `description`.
        tech_config (dict): Technology-specific configuration dictionary.
