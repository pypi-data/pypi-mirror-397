# Version management:
# Documentation is immutable per release. Each git tag (v0.1.0, v0.2.0, etc.) produces
# a frozen snapshot of the docs as they were at that release.
#
# - Tags (v0.1.0, v0.2.0, ...): Immutable doc snapshots
# - main/master branches: Development version docs (always latest)
#
# This ensures historical accuracy: users viewing old version docs see them exactly
# as they were released, not retrospectively updated.
