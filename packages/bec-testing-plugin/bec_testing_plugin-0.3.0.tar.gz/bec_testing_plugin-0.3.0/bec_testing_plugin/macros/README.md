# Macros

This directory is intended to store macros which will be loaded automatically when starting BEC.
Macros are small functions to make repetitive tasks easier. Functions defined in python files in this directory will be accessible from the BEC console.
Please do not put any code outside of function definitions here. If you wish for code to be automatically run when starting BEC, see the startup script at bec_testing_plugin/bec_ipython_client/startup/post_startup.py
For a guide on writing macros, please see: https://bec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/command_line_interface.html#how-to-write-a-macro
