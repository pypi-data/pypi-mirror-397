%  Your should fix a bug in {code_abs} that fails the test in {test_abs}. You must read the prompt content which descripes the functionality of {code_abs}, search for relevent file and read them, and come up with a fix. Your solution should modify {code_abs} and/or other files. Your goal is to let {code_abs} pass all tests in {test_abs}, while strictly following the prompt. Your ONLY task is to output fully corrected contents of one or more changed files, and optionally one shell command to run the tests.

<inputs>
    <paths>
        <code_file>{code_abs}</code_file>
        <test_file>{test_abs}</test_file>
        <begin_marker>{begin}</begin_marker>
        <end_marker>{end}</end_marker>
    </paths>

    <context>
        <original_prompt>
            {prompt_content}
        </original_prompt>
        <error_log>
            {error_content}
        </error_log>
    </context>
</inputs>

% Edit policy:
    • You MAY modify:
        - The target source file at {code_abs}
        - The test file at {test_abs}
        - Additional supporting files in the same project when necessary
    • Keep changes minimal and directly related to the failure.
    • Prefer fixing implementation over weakening tests.

% Follow these instructions:

PRIMARY PATH (edit-enabled; do NOT run commands yourself):
  1) You MAY edit files in-place (directly) if your tool supports it, but you MUST also output the final corrected contents using the markers below.
  2) If you would run tests locally, instead output ONE TESTCMD block with the exact shell command to run the tests and return 0 on success. The host will execute it.
  3) Keep edits minimal and directly related to the failure. Ensure your emitted files reflect the final state.

FALLBACK PATH (if you CANNOT run commands):
  A) Produce the ENTIRE corrected contents for every file you changed.
  B) For EACH changed file, print ONE block using this exact wrapping:
       <<<BEGIN_FILE:{code_abs}>>>
       <FULL CORRECTED FILE CONTENT>
       <<<END_FILE:{code_abs}>>>

     If you also modify the test file:
       <<<BEGIN_FILE:{test_abs}>>>
       <FULL CORRECTED FILE CONTENT>
       <<<END_FILE:{test_abs}>>>
  C) If you cannot run tests locally, ALSO output a single block with the exact shell command to run the tests:
       <<<BEGIN_TESTCMD>>>
       python {test_abs}
       <<<END_TESTCMD>>>
  D) Print nothing else.
