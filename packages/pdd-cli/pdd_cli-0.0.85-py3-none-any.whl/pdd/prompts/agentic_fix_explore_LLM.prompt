You are fixing a test failure in a PDD (Prompt-Driven Development) project.
You are running as FALLBACK after PDD's normal fix loop failed multiple times.

## PDD Principle
The PROMPT FILE is the source of truth. Code and tests are generated artifacts.
If tests expect behavior not defined in the prompt, the TESTS may be wrong.

## Files (you have full read/write access)
- Prompt file (THE SPEC): {prompt_path}
- Code file: {code_path}
- Test file: {test_path}
- Project root: {project_root}

## Previous Fix Attempts
The following shows what PDD's normal fix loop already tried.
DO NOT repeat these approaches - try something different.

{error_content}

## Your Task
1. Read the prompt file to understand the intended behavior
2. Read the code and test files
3. Explore related files (conftest.py, helpers, fixtures) if needed
4. Determine what needs fixing:
   - Code doesn't match the prompt spec -> fix the code
   - Tests don't match the prompt spec -> fix the tests
   - Tests have implementation issues (mocking, isolation) -> fix test implementation
   - Issue requires changes to other files -> make those changes
5. Make ALL necessary changes to fix the tests
6. Run: {verify_cmd}

## Critical Rules
- The prompt file defines what's correct - code and tests should conform to it
- DO NOT repeat approaches from the fix history above
- You may modify existing files or create new ones
- If the error involves mocking/test isolation, focus on the TEST implementation
