Supply-Chain Firewall is a command-line tool for preventing the installation of malicious PyPI and npm packages.  It is intended primarily for use by engineers to protect their development workstations from compromise in a supply-chain attack.

![scfw demo usage](https://github.com/DataDog/supply-chain-firewall/blob/main/images/demo.gif?raw=true)

Given a command for a supported package manager, Supply-Chain Firewall collects all package targets that would be installed by the command and verifies them against reputable sources of data on open source malware and vulnerabilities.  The command is automatically blocked from running when any verifier returns critical findings for any target, generally indicating that the target in question is malicious.  In cases where a verifier reports warnings for a target, they are presented to the user along with a prompt confirming intent to proceed with the installation.

By default, Supply-Chain Firewall includes verifiers for the following data sources:

- Datadog Security Research's public [malicious packages dataset](https://github.com/DataDog/malicious-software-packages-dataset)
- [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev) advisories, both for malicious packages as well as vulnerabilities
- User-provided lists of custom findings, expressed as YAML (see template in `examples/findings_list.yaml`)

Refer to the API documentation for details of configuring and using these default verifiers.

Users may also implement their own custom verifiers for alternative data sources. A template for implementating a custom verifier may be found in `examples/verifier.py`. Details may also be found in the API documentation.

The principal goal of Supply-Chain Firewall is to block 100% of installations of known-malicious packages within the purview of its data sources.

## Getting started

### Installation

The recommended way to install Supply-Chain Firewall is via [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/):

```bash
$ pipx install scfw
```

This will install the `scfw` command-line program into an isolated Python environment on your system and make it available in any other Python environment, including ephemeral ones created with `venv` or `virtualenv`.  `pipx` may be installed via Homebrew on macOS or via the system package manager on major Linux distributions.  Be sure to run `pipx ensurepath` after installation to properly configure your `PATH`.

Supply-Chain Firewall can also be installed via `pip install scfw` directly into the active Python environment.

To check whether the installation succeeded, run the following command and verify that you see output similar to the following.

```bash
$ scfw --version
2.5.0
```

### Post-installation steps

To get the most out of Supply-Chain Firewall, it is recommended to run the `scfw configure` command after installation.  This script will walk you through configuring your environment so that all commands for supported package managers are passively run through `scfw` as well as enabling Datadog logging, described in more detail below.

```bash
$ scfw configure
...
```

### Compatibility and limitations

|  Package manager  |   Supported versions  |        Inspected subcommands       |
| :---------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------------------: |
| npm               | >= 7.0                | `install` (including aliases)      |
| pip               | >= 22.2               | `install`                          |
| poetry            | >= 1.7                | `add`, `install`, `sync`, `update` |

Supply-Chain Firewall may only know how to inspect some of the "installish" subcommands for its supported package managers.  These are shown in the above table.  Any other subcommands are always allowed to run.

By default, `scfw` will refuse to run inspected subcommands with an unsupported version of a supported package manager.  This is in keeping with its goal of blocking 100% of known-malicious package installations.  In order to get the most out of `scfw`, please verify that you are running a supported version of your package manager and upgrade accordingly before using this tool.

Currently, Supply-Chain Firewall is only fully supported on macOS systems, though it should run as intended on common Linux distributions.  It is currently not supported on Windows.

### Uninstalling Supply-Chain Firewall

Supply-Chain Firewall may be uninstalled via `pip(x) uninstall scfw`.  Before doing so, be sure to run the command `scfw configure --remove` to remove any Supply-Chain Firewall-managed configuration you may have previously added to your environment.

```bash
$ scfw configure --remove
...
```

## Usage

### Inspect package manager commands

To use Supply-Chain Firewall to inspect a package manager command, simply prepend `scfw run` to the command you intend to run:

```
$ scfw run npm install react
$ scfw run pip install -r requirements.txt
$ scfw run poetry add git+https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog
```

For `pip install` commands, packages will be installed in the same environment (virtual or global) in which the command was run.

Several command-line options of the `run` subcommand are noteworthy:

* `--dry-run`: Verify any installation targets but do not run the package manager command. The exit code indicates whether there were findings of any severity

* `--allow-on-warning` and `--block-on-warning`: Non-interactively allow or block commands, respectively, with only warning-level findings. Setting the environment variable `SCFW_ON_WARNING` to `"ALLOW"` or `"BLOCK"` achieves the same effect, with the CLI options taking priority over the environment variable when both are used

* `--error-on-block`: Treat blocked commands as errors (useful for scripting)

Run `scfw run --help` to see all available command-line options.

### Audit installed packages

Supply-Chain Firewall can also use its verifiers to audit installed packages:

```
$ scfw audit npm
No issues found.

$ scfw audit --executable venv/bin/python pip
Package pip-23.0.1:
  - An OSV.dev advisory exists for package pip-23.0.1:
      * [Medium] https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-mq26-g339-26xf
  - An OSV.dev advisory exists for package pip-23.0.1:
      * [Low] https://osv.dev/vulnerability/PYSEC-2023-228
Package setuptools-65.5.0:
  - An OSV.dev advisory exists for package setuptools-65.5.0:
      * [High] https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-cx63-2mw6-8hw5
  - An OSV.dev advisory exists for package setuptools-65.5.0:
      * [High] https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-5rjg-fvgr-3xxf
  - An OSV.dev advisory exists for package setuptools-65.5.0:
      * [High] https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-r9hx-vwmv-q579
  - An OSV.dev advisory exists for package setuptools-65.5.0:
      * https://osv.dev/vulnerability/PYSEC-2022-43012
```

Supply-Chain Firewall audits all installed packages visible to the package manager in the invoking environment.  The user may specify the package manager executable they wish to use on the command line.  For `npm` and `poetry` audits, Supply-Chain Firewall assumes the project of interest is in the current working directory.

Currently, `npm` audits do not take globally installed packages into consideration.  To audit a globally installed `npm` package, first `cd` into the package's directory (inside the global `node_modules/`) and perform a local audit there.

## Datadog Log Management integration

Supply-Chain Firewall can maintain a local JSON Lines log file that records all completed `run` and `audit` executions.  The environment variable `SCFW_LOG_FILE` may be used to change where SCFW writes these logs, with the default location being `$SCFW_HOME/scfw.log`.  Users are strongly encouraged to set either `SCFW_LOG_FILE` or `SCFW_HOME` in order to benefit from this local logging.

Supply-Chain Firewall can also optionally send logs of blocked and successful installations to Datadog.

![scfw datadog log](https://github.com/DataDog/supply-chain-firewall/blob/main/images/datadog_log.png?raw=true)

Users can configure their environments so that Supply-Chain Firewall forwards logs either via the Datadog HTTP API (requires an API key) or to a local Datadog Agent process.  Configuration consists of setting necessary environment variables and, for Agent log forwarding, configuring the Datadog Agent to accept logs from Supply-Chain Firewall.  Note that the Datadog Agent must already be separately [configured](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/logs/#activate-log-collection) for log collection in order to use this option.

To opt in, use the `scfw configure` command to interactively or non-interactively configure your environment for Datadog logging.  API key users can additionally set the appropriate [Datadog site parameter](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/#access-the-datadog-site) via the `DD_SITE` environment variable.

Custom Datadog log attributes relevant to your use-case may be supplied via an environment variable or a file containing a single JSON object.

```bash
$ SCFW_DD_LOG_ATTRIBUTES='{"mascot_name": "Bits", "location": "New York"}' scfw run pip install datadog-api-client
```

By default, SCFW looks for this file at `$SCFW_HOME/dd_logger/log_attributes.json`, or a custom filepath may be supplied via the environment variable `SCFW_DD_LOG_ATTRIBUTES_FILE`.  Otherwise, custom attributes may be provided via the environment variable `SCFW_DD_LOG_ATTRIBUTES`, with the environment variable values overriding those read from file in case of overlap.

Supply-Chain Firewall can integrate with user-supplied loggers.  A template for implementating a custom logger may be found in `examples/logger.py`. Refer to the API documentation for details.
