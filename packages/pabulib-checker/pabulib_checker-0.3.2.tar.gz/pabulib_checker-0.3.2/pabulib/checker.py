            files (List[Union[str, bytes]]): A list of file paths or raw content to process.

        Returns:

        1. Parse file content into sections (meta, projects, votes, etc.).
        2. Validate the structure and content of the parsed data.
        3. Record errors and metadata for each processed file.
