# PyPNM Release Guide (Single-Branch Model Using `tools/release.py`)

This guide describes how to manage versions and releases for the PyPNM project using a single primary branch and the `tools/release.py` helper script. The `release` script is the primary entry point for bumping versions, running tests, creating tags, and pushing changes.

## 1. Branch Model

For current PyPNM development, a **single-branch** model is used:

- `main`  
  Active development and release branch. All regular work and official releases happen from `main`.

Optional branches you may use later:

- `feature/*`  
  Short-lived branches for experiments or isolated changes. Merge back into `main` when done, then delete.

- `stable` (optional, future)  
  You can introduce a `stable` branch later if you need a dedicated GA branch. For now, it is not required; tags on `main` provide clear release points.

When in doubt, work directly on `main`, create tags for each release, and use Git history plus tags to reproduce any version.

## 2. Version Source Of Truth And Mirrored Locations

The canonical version string is defined in a single Python module and mirrored into `pyproject.toml` by the release tooling.

Canonical source:

```text
src/pypnm/version.py
```

Recommended structure:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

__all__ = ["__version__"]

# MAJOR.MINOR.MAINTENANCE.BUILD
__version__: str = "0.2.1.0"
```

Rules:

- Treat `src/pypnm/version.py` as the **single source of truth**.  
- The `[project].version` field in `pyproject.toml` is a **mirror** that must always match `__version__`.  
- Do not hand-edit the version in `pyproject.toml`; let the release script maintain it.

Example FastAPI wiring:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pypnm.version import __version__

app = FastAPI(
    title="PyPNM REST API",
    version=__version__,
    description=fast_api_description,
    openapi_url="/openapi.json",
    docs_url="/docs",
    redoc_url="/redoc",
)
```

### 2.1 Files Touched By A Release

When you run the release script, it updates or validates these locations:

- `src/pypnm/version.py`  
  Canonical `__version__` definition. Updated to the new four-part version string.

- `pyproject.toml`  
  `[project].version` is kept in lockstep with `__version__`. Updated to the same value as in `src/pypnm/version.py`.

The release script also performs git operations (commit, tag, push) once the version is updated and tests pass.

## 3. Versioning Scheme

PyPNM uses a four-part version:

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.MAINTENANCE.BUILD
```

Guidelines:

- `MAJOR`  
  Increment when there are significant breaking changes or large structural shifts.

- `MINOR`  
  Increment when adding features in a backward-compatible way.

- `MAINTENANCE`  
  Increment when fixing bugs or making compatible improvements that are smaller than a full minor release.

- `BUILD`  
  Increment for very small hotfixes or internal rebuilds that do not change public behavior but still need a distinct version.

Examples:

- `0.2.1.0` - Minor feature set with maintenance updates.  
- `0.2.2.0` - Next maintenance release.  
- `0.3.0.0` - Next minor release.  
- `1.0.0.0` - First major release.

All four segments must be numeric. Both `src/pypnm/version.py` and `pyproject.toml` must carry the same four-part string after a release.

## 4. Release Script Overview (`tools/release.py`)

The `tools/release.py` script is the primary entry point for performing a release. It is responsible for:

- Computing or accepting a target version.  
- Updating version strings in both version files.  
- Running the test suite.  
- Creating a release commit.  
- Tagging the release.  
- Pushing branch and tags to `origin`.

You typically run this script directly; it internally handles all version file changes.

### 4.1 High Level Release Steps

When you run `tools/release.py` (and confirm the prompt when applicable), it performs the following:

1. Read the current version from `src/pypnm/version.py`.  
2. Read the `[project].version` from `pyproject.toml` and verify they match.  
3. Compute the target version, either:
   - From an explicit `--version` argument, or  
   - From a `--next` mode (major, minor, maintenance, build), or  
   - From an implicit **maintenance bump** when neither `--version` nor `--next` is provided.  
4. Display the planned version bump (for auto-computed versions) and wait for a `y` / `yes` confirmation.  
5. Ensure the git working tree is clean.  
6. Checkout the target branch (default `main`) and pull with `--ff-only`.  
7. Update both version files to the target version.  
8. Optionally run `pytest` (unless `--skip-tests` is used).  
9. Optionally run local Docker build + health preflight (`tools/local_container_build.sh --smoke`; skip with `--skip-docker-test`).  
10. Build docs with `mkdocs --strict`.  
11. Commit the version bump.  
12. Create an annotated git tag.  
13. Push the branch and tag to `origin`.

If any step fails (for example, tests fail or versions do not match), the script prints an error and exits without completing the release.

## 5. Release Modes And Examples

You can run the release script in different ways depending on how you want to control the version.

### 5.1 Automatic Maintenance Release (Default)

If you run `tools/release.py` with no version arguments, it computes the **next maintenance version** automatically.

Example:

```bash
tools/release.py
```

Behavior:

- Reads `current_version` (for example `0.2.1.0`).  
- Computes `next_version` as the next maintenance version (for example `0.2.2.0`).  
- Prints:

  ```text
  Current version: 0.2.1.0
  Planned version bump: 0.2.1.0 -> 0.2.2.0
  Proceed with release? [y/N]:
  ```

- Only proceeds with the release if you respond with `y` or `yes`. Any other input aborts.

This mode is convenient for routine maintenance updates.

### 5.2 Automatic Next Version By Mode (`--next`)

You can ask the script to compute the next version using a specific mode:

```bash
tools/release.py --next major
tools/release.py --next minor
tools/release.py --next maintenance
tools/release.py --next build
```

Behavior:

- Reads the current version.  
- Computes the next version using the requested mode.  
- Shows the current and proposed version, then waits for a `y` / `yes` confirmation.  
- Runs the release flow after you confirm.

Use this when you want to clearly indicate the type of release (major, minor, maintenance, build) without manually typing the version string.

### 5.3 Explicit Version (`--version`)

If you want complete control of the target version, you can pass it explicitly:

```bash
tools/release.py --version 0.3.0.0
```

Behavior:

- Validates the explicit version string.  
- Skips auto-computation since you already chose the version.  
- Does not ask for version confirmation (you have already decided the version).  
- Proceeds with the release steps directly.

This mode is helpful when you have a predefined release version (for example, aligning with external documentation or planning notes).

### 5.4 Dry Run (`--dry-run`)

You can preview what the script would do without performing any changes:

```bash
tools/release.py --dry-run
tools/release.py --next minor --dry-run
tools/release.py --version 0.3.0.0 --dry-run
```

Behavior:

- Computes the target version (if needed).  
- Prints a step-by-step list of planned actions, including the version bump and git operations.  
- Exits without touching any files, running tests, committing, tagging, or pushing.

Use this to sanity-check a release before running it for real.

### 5.5 Skipping Tests (`--skip-tests`)

You can skip running `pytest` during a release (not recommended for normal use):

```bash
tools/release.py --skip-tests
tools/release.py --next minor --skip-tests
tools/release.py --version 0.3.0.0 --skip-tests
```

The release flow remains the same except the test step is skipped.

### 5.6 Target Branch (`--branch`) And Tag Prefix (`--tag-prefix`)

By default, the release script operates on `main` and uses `v` as the tag prefix.

You can override these:

```bash
# Release from stable
tools/release.py --branch stable

# Release from stable with minor bump
tools/release.py --branch stable --next minor

# Use a custom tag prefix, for example pypnm-0.3.0.0
tools/release.py --version 0.3.0.0 --tag-prefix pypnm-
```

The tag name is always built as `<tag-prefix><version>`, for example:

- `v0.2.2.0`  
- `pypnm-0.3.0.0`

## 6. Standard Release Flow On `main`

Below is an example of a typical release workflow using automatic maintenance bumping on `main`:

```bash
# 1) Make sure main is up to date and clean
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git status

# 2) Optional: inspect the current version
tools/release.py --dry-run

# 3) Run the real release (auto maintenance bump)
tools/release.py
```

Results:

- `src/pypnm/version.py` is updated (for example `0.2.1.0` -> `0.2.2.0`).  
- `pyproject.toml` `[project].version` is updated to the same value.  
- A commit `Release 0.2.2.0` is added on `main`.  
- Tag `v0.2.2.0` is created and pushed to `origin`.  
- You can later reproduce this release with:

  ```bash
  git checkout v0.2.2.0
  ```

If you prefer to explicitly control version semantics, replace the last step with:

```bash
# Minor release
tools/release.py --next minor

# Or a fully explicit version
tools/release.py --version 0.3.0.0
```

## 7. Quick Reference

- Automatic maintenance release (prompted):

  ```bash
  tools/release.py
  ```

- Automatic next version by mode (prompted):

  ```bash
  tools/release.py --next major
  tools/release.py --next minor
  tools/release.py --next maintenance
  tools/release.py --next build
  ```

- Explicit version (no version prompt):

  ```bash
  tools/release.py --version 0.3.0.0
  ```

- Dry run only:

  ```bash
  tools/release.py --dry-run
  ```

- Release from another branch (for example future `stable`):

  ```bash
  tools/release.py --branch stable --next minor
  ```

With this model, the `tools/release.py` script is the primary entry point for PyPNM releases. It computes or accepts the version, updates all necessary version files, runs tests, commits, tags, and pushes the result, giving you a repeatable and controlled release process.
