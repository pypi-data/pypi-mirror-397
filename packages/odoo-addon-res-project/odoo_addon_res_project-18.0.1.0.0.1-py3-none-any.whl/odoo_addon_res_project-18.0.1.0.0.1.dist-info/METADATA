This module is one of the master data used in all Project sections as
information

This module adds the possibility of defining a sequence for the
project's reference. The reference is then set as the default when
creating a new project, using the defined sequence.

NOTE: Before installing this module, you should check the following
information

- For projects that have a parent project, the code will be overwritten
  with the code of the parent project and followed by a sub-code, such
  as PJ00001-1

- For main projects, if the code already exists, it will not be changed.
  However, if the code does not exist, a new code will be automatically
  assigned

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
