# Keep Awake

Keep your system on and screen on, it will not fall asleep. It is useful in some long term calculations.



## How to use?

```shell
pip install keep_awake
```

This module exposes only two methods: `prevent_sleep` and `allow_sleep`, both of them taks no arguments.

`prevent_sleep` returns a boolean value that indicates whether the operation is successful. After you call this method, your system and screen will keep working until you invoke `allow_sleep`.

You won't have any exceptions by calling any methods twice, or calling `allow_sleep` without calling `prevent_sleep`, they have built-in protection.

If you forget to call `allow_sleep` before exiting your program, it doesn't matter, it will back to usual once the module is released.

We also provide a context manager for you to manage the state automatically, just like this:

```python
from keep_awake import KeepAwakeGuard

with KeepAwakeGuard():
    # do your work here
```



## Supported platforms

### macOS✅

Both arm64 and x64 are OK, this code only depends on `IOKit` and `CoreFoundation`, which is built-in macOS Framework.

Methods on macOS are concurrent safe.



### Windows✅

We didn't test widely on various versions of Windows because I have no more Windows computer :(

But basically, it can work fine on `Windows 10 x64` and `Windows 11 x64`. I have already tested.

Methods on Windows are concurrent safe.



### Linux⚠️

Linux distros are various, we can only support Gnome and KDE. They have dbus api so this part is implemented in pure python. If you need this feature, please install with this command:

```shell
pip install keep_awake[linux]
```

If you failed to install, try to use your package manager to install `cmake`, `pkg-config`, `libdbus-1-dev` and `libglib2.0-dev`.

Methods on Linux are concurrent safe.



## Building & Debugging

We use `uv` to manage the project, so it is very easy to build and test it.

For building:

```shell
uv build
```

For testing

```shell
uv run pytest
```
