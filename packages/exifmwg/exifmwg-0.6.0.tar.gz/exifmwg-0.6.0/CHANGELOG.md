## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-15

### Changed

- Bumps libexpat to 2.7.3

### Added

- Adds Python 3.14 wheels

### Removed

- Python 3.9 support was dropped

## [0.5.0] - 2025-09-21

### Breaking

- Refactored `ImageMetadata::toFile()` method into three distinct methods for clearer semantics:
  - `save()` - Updates the original file (replaces `toFile()` with no parameters). If no original file was set, raises an error
  - `toFile(path)` - Updates an existing file at the specified path. If the target doesn't exist, raises an error
  - `copyTo(path)` - Creates a new file by copying the original and updating metadata
- The original `toFile(std::optional<fs::path>)` method has been removed
- Python bindings updated to reflect the new method signatures
- Improved error handling with clearer error messages for each operation type

## [0.4.0] - 2025-06-30

### Changed

- Image metadata is now read and written through the single class `ImageMetadata` ([#7](https://github.com/stumpylog/exifmwg/pull/7))

  - Additionally, keywords are now sorted at all levels, based on the keyword value and applied value
  - Keywords are built from and written to the following:
    - [Xmp.MicrosoftPhoto.LastKeywordXMP](https://exiftool.org/TagNames/Microsoft.html#XMP)
    - [Xmp.digiKam.TagsList](https://exiftool.org/TagNames/XMP.html#digiKam)

### Removed

- For now, metadata clearing has been removed until a later date

### Added

- C++ code now integrates with the standard Python logging, under `exifmwg` namespace ([#8](https://github.com/stumpylog/exifmwg/pull/8))
- C++ code is statically analyzed via [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/), [clang static analyzer](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/), [cppcheck](https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/) and [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) ([#9](https://github.com/stumpylog/exifmwg/pull/9))

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-13

### Added

- C++ unit tests now include PNG and WebP images in at least a basic fashion

### Changed

- PNG support is firmly disable for Windows builds now

### Fixed

- Removed the debug printing to `stderr` for release builds
- Fixed an issue where images with no `Xmp.mwg-rs.Regions` key would still try to parse regions

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-12

### Changed

- Transitions to using a Python native module, linked against Exiv2, an no longer relies on exiftool ([#3](https://github.com/stumpylog/exifmwg/pull/3))
  - Uses Exiv2 v0.28.5
  - Uses libexpat 2.7.1
  - Uses zlib 1.3.1
  - PNG files are not maybe supported on Windows (yet), thanks to zlib linking problems on that platform
- Bump pypa/cibuildwheel from 2.23.3 to 3.0.0 ([#5](https://github.com/stumpylog/exifmwg/pull/5))
- Bump codecov/codecov-action from 4 to 5 ([#4](https://github.com/stumpylog/exifmwg/pull/4))
