              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

**Agent Memory Hub** is the enterprise-standard solution for managing **long-term memory for AI agents** with strict **region governance**. Designed for developers building scalable agentic workflows, it provides a unified interface to store, recall, and manage agent state across diverse storage backends while ensuring compliance with data residency laws (GDPR, CCPA).

Whether you are building a simple chatbot or a complex multi-agent system, `agent-memory-hub` abstracts the complexity of state management, letting you focus on agent logic.

---

## 🚀 What is Agent Memory Hub?

Agent Memory Hub is a Python SDK that acts as a middleware between your AI agents (built with LangChain, AutoGen, OpenAI, etc.) and your storage infrastructure. It creates a structured "brain" for your agents where every interaction, fact, or retrieved context is indexed by **Agent ID** and **Session ID**.

Crucially, it introduces **Region Governance** as a first-class citizen. You can strictly enforce that an agent's memory never leaves a specific geographic region (e.g., `europe-west1`), which is critical for enterprise applications handling sensitive user data.

## 💡 Why Use It?

- **Data Sovereignty & Compliance**: Native support for **region governance**. If an agent is configured for `europe-west1`, the SDK physically prevents writes to `us-central1` storage buckets.
- **Backend Agnostic**: Switch from **Google Cloud Storage** to **AlloyDB**, **Redis**, or **Firestore** without changing your agent code.
- **Session Isolation**: Automatically segregates memories by session, making it perfect for conversational agents and RAG pipelines.
- **Production Ready**: Typed, tested, and security-scanned. No hardcoded secrets.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The library uses an **Adapter Pattern** to connect to various storage backends. When you initialize a `MemoryClient`, you specify the _Agent_, _Session_, and _Region_.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[AI Agent] -->|Write/Recall| B(MemoryClient)
    B -->|Region Check| C{Region Allowed?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Storage Adapter]
    C -->|No| E[Error]
    D -->|Persist| F[(GCS / AlloyDB / Redis)]
```

1. **Initialize**: Create a client with specific region constraints.
2. **Interact**: Use `.write()` to save state and `.recall()` to fetch context.
3. **Govern**: The SDK handles the routing and compliance checks transparently.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
pip install agent-memory-hub

# For specific backends
pip install "agent-memory-hub[alloydb]"
pip install "agent-memory-hub[redis]"
```

## ⚡ Quick Start & Examples

We provide ready-to-use examples for common scenarios:

### 1. OpenAI Agent Integration

Inject long-term memory into your OpenAI API calls to personalize responses.

- [View Example](examples/openai_agents_integration.py)

```python
from agent_memory_hub import MemoryClient
# ... initialization ...
memory.write("User prefers concise Python code.")
context = memory.recall()
# Inject 'context' into your system prompt
```

### 2. Multi-Region Architecture

Manage distinct compliance requirements for global user bases.

- [View Example](examples/multi_region_memory_architecture.py)

```python
# This client will ONLY write to EU-based storage
eu_memory = MemoryClient(agent_id="eu_bot", region="europe-west1", region_restricted=True)
```

### 3. RAG Agent with Memory

Enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by caching retrieved context and user interactions.

- [View Example](examples/rag_agent_with_region_memory.py)
