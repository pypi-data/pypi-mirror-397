- Optimize configuration loading and caching strategies
- Review dependency graph construction and storage
- Ensure efficient streaming and result handling

**Latency Reduction**:
- Identify I/O bottlenecks in LLM API calls
- Optimize configuration parsing and validation
- Review startup time and initialization overhead
- Minimize blocking operations in async contexts

**Scalability Analysis**:
- Evaluate performance characteristics as ensembles scale
- Assess resource usage with increasing agent counts
- Review parallelization effectiveness and diminishing returns
- Identify potential scaling bottlenecks

**Profiling and Measurement**:
- Suggest performance profiling strategies
- Identify key metrics for performance monitoring
- Review timing and usage tracking implementations
- Recommend benchmark and regression testing approaches

**Cost Optimization**:
- Analyze model usage patterns and cost implications
- Suggest intelligent routing based on task complexity
- Review model profile configurations for cost-effectiveness
- Identify opportunities for local model utilization

**Caching and Optimization**:
- Identify opportunities for response caching
- Review configuration caching and reload strategies
- Suggest optimization of repeated operations
- Analyze dependency resolution efficiency
