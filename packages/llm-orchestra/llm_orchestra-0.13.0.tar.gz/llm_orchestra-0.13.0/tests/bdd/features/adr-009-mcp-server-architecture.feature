Feature: MCP Server Architecture
  As an MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.)
  I want to interact with llm-orc via the Model Context Protocol
  So that I can discover, execute, and manage ensembles programmatically

  Background:
    Given an MCP server instance is available

  # Resource: List all ensembles
  @resource @ensembles
  Scenario: List all available ensembles via MCP resource
    Given ensembles exist in local, library, and global directories

    And results should include matching ensembles or scripts

  @tool @library @phase2
  Scenario: Search library with no matches
    Given the library contains ensembles and scripts
    When I call the "library_search" tool with:
      | query | zzz_nonexistent_zzz                      |
    Then I should receive empty search results

  # Tool: Library info
  @tool @library @phase2
  Scenario: Get library information
    Given the library is configured
    When I call the "library_info" tool
    Then I should receive library metadata
    And the metadata should include path and counts

  # =============================================================================
  # Phase 3: Provider & Model Discovery
  # =============================================================================

  # Tool: Get provider status
  @tool @provider @phase3
  Scenario: Get provider status with Ollama available
    Given Ollama is running locally with models
    When I call the "get_provider_status" tool
    Then I should receive provider status
    And the status should show Ollama as available
    And the status should include available Ollama models

  @tool @provider @phase3
  Scenario: Get provider status when Ollama is unavailable
    Given Ollama is not running
    When I call the "get_provider_status" tool
    Then I should receive provider status
    And the status should show Ollama as unavailable

  @tool @provider @phase3
  Scenario: Get provider status shows cloud provider configuration
    Given authentication is configured for some providers
    When I call the "get_provider_status" tool
    Then I should receive provider status
    And the status should indicate which cloud providers are configured

  # Tool: Check ensemble runnable
  @tool @runnable @phase3
  Scenario: Check runnable ensemble with all providers available
    Given an ensemble using only Ollama profiles exists
    And Ollama is running locally with the required models
    When I call the "check_ensemble_runnable" tool with:
      | ensemble_name | validate-ollama |
    Then I should receive runnable status
    And the ensemble should be marked as runnable
    And all agents should have status "available"

  @tool @runnable @phase3
  Scenario: Check ensemble with missing profile
    Given an ensemble using a non-existent profile exists
    When I call the "check_ensemble_runnable" tool with:
      | ensemble_name | security-review |
    Then I should receive runnable status
    And the ensemble should be marked as not runnable
    And at least one agent should have status "missing_profile"

  @tool @runnable @phase3
  Scenario: Check ensemble with unavailable provider
    Given an ensemble using a cloud provider exists
    And the cloud provider is not configured
    When I call the "check_ensemble_runnable" tool with:
      | ensemble_name | startup-advisory-board |
    Then I should receive runnable status
    And the ensemble should be marked as not runnable
    And affected agents should have local alternatives suggested

  @tool @runnable @phase3
  Scenario: Check non-existent ensemble
    Given no ensemble named "non-existent" exists
    When I call the "check_ensemble_runnable" tool with:
      | ensemble_name | non-existent |
    Then I should receive an error indicating ensemble not found
