# PlotPy: Curve and image plotting tools for Python/Qt applications

[![PyPI status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/plotpy.svg)](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/plotpy/)

ℹ️ Created in 2016 by [Pierre Raybaut](https://github.com/PierreRaybaut) and maintained by the [PlotPyStack](https://github.com/PlotPyStack) organization.

ℹ️ PlotPy ***V2*** is the new major release of [`guiqwt`](https://github.com/PierreRaybaut/guiqwt): same team 🏋️, same goal 🎯, same long-term support ⏳.

## Overview

`plotpy` is is a Python library providing efficient 2D data-plotting features for interactive computing and signal/image processing application development.
It is part of the [PlotPyStack](https://github.com/PlotPyStack) project, aiming at providing a unified framework for creating scientific GUIs with Python and Qt.

`plotpy` is based on:

* [Python](http://www.python.org) language and [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/) GUI toolkit
* [guidata](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/guidata) automatic GUI generation library
* [PythonQwt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonQwt) plotting widgets library
* [NumPy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/NumPy) and [SciPy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SciPy) scientific computing libraries

See [documentation](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details on the library.

* Licensed under the terms of the BSD 3-Clause (see [LICENSE](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/PlotPy/blob/master/LICENSE)).

## Features

The `plotpy` library also provides the following features.

General plotting features:

* Ready-to-use [plot widgets and dialog boxes](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/plot/index.html)
* [pyplot](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/pyplot.html): interactive plotting widgets, equivalent to `matplotlib.pyplot`, at least for the implemented functions
* Supported [plot items](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/items/index.html): curves, images, contours, histograms, labels, shapes, annotations, ...

Interactive features (i.e. not only programmatic plotting but also with mouse/keyboard):

* Multiple object selection for moving objects or editing their properties through automatically generated dialog boxes
* Item list panel: move objects from foreground to background, show/hide objects, remove objects, ...
* Customizable aspect ratio for images
* Tons of ready-to-use tools: plot canvas export to image file, image snapshot, interval selection, image rectangular filter, etc.
* Curve fitting tool with automatic fit, manual fit with sliders, ...
* Contrast adjustment panel for images: select the LUT by moving a range selection object on the image levels histogram, eliminate outliers, ...
* X-axis and Y-axis cross-sections: support for multiple images, average cross-section tool on a rectangular area, ...
* Apply any affine transform to displayed images in real-time (rotation, magnification, translation, horizontal/vertical flip, ...)

Application development helpers:

* Ready-to-use [plot widgets and dialog boxes](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/plot/index.html)
* Load/save graphical objects (curves, images, shapes) into HDF5, JSON or INI files
* A lot of test scripts which demonstrate `plotpy` features (see [examples](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/examples.html))

## Dependencies and installation

### Supported Qt versions and bindings

The whole PlotPyStack set of libraries relies on the [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/) GUI toolkit, thanks to [QtPy](https://pypi.org/project/QtPy/), an abstraction layer which allows to use the same API to interact with different Python-to-Qt bindings (PyQt5, PyQt6, PySide2, PySide6).

Compatibility table:

| PlotPy version | PyQt5 | PyQt6 | PySide2 | PySide6 |
|----------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| 2.0-2.5        | ✅    | ⚠️    | ❌     | ⚠️      |
| Latest         | ✅    | ✅    | ❌     | ✅      |

### Other dependencies and installation

See [Installation](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/installation.html) section in the documentation for more details.
