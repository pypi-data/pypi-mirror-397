# Kubeflow Pipelines extension for Metaflow

Compile and run Metaflow flows on Kubeflow Pipelines (**argo workflows** backend).

## Basic Usage

- Have access to a Kubeflow Pipelines instance with the API server URL.
- Use the CLI commands to compile your flow into a Kubeflow Pipeline and deploy it.

## Compiling and Deploying a Pipeline

```py
python my_flow.py kubeflow-pipelines create \
    --url https://my-kubeflow-instance.com
```

This command will:

- Compile your Metaflow flow into a Kubeflow Pipeline YAML specification
- Upload it to your Kubeflow Pipelines instance
- Create a new version of the pipeline

The Kubeflow Pipelines URL can also be configured via the environment variable: `METAFLOW_KUBEFLOW_PIPELINES_URL`

## Available Commands

### 1. **create** - Compile and/or Deploy Pipeline

Compile a new version of your flow to Kubeflow Pipelines:

```py
python my_flow.py kubeflow-pipelines create \
    --url https://my-kubeflow-instance.com \
    --version-name v1.0.0
```

Use `--help` for all available options including `tags`, `namespace`, `max-workers`, and production token management.

The `--version-name` allows one to deploy a custom version name. Else, a new version with UTC timestamp is created on each subsequent usage.

One can also pass `--yaml-only` for exporting the YAML file without uploading to Kubeflow Pipelines.

### 2. **trigger** - Execute Pipeline

Trigger an execution of your deployed pipeline:

```py
python my_flow.py kubeflow-pipelines trigger \
    --url https://my-kubeflow-instance.com \
    --experiment my-experiment \
    --alpha 0.1 \
    --max-epochs 100
```

Flow parameters can be passed as command-line arguments. Use `--help` for all available options.

By default, the latest version of the deployed pipeline is used for the trigger. Else, one can also pass in a custom version using `--version-name`.

### 3. **status** - Check Execution Status

Fetch the status of a running or completed pipeline execution:

```py
python my_flow.py kubeflow-pipelines status \
    --url https://my-kubeflow-instance.com \
    --kfp-run-id abc-123-def-456
```

Use `--help` for all available options.
