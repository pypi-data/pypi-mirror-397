# Repo Folder Hierarchy

* flexrio - root repo folder
    * baseboards - common HDL source used across multiple targets
    * dependencies - dependencies of targets delivered via zip file from the repo's release artifact
    * docs - documentation
    * fixedlogic - common HDL source used across multiple targets
    * ipcores - common HDL source used across multiple targets
    * targets - FPGA targets
        * common - common HDL source used across multiple targets
        * pxie-7xxx - Specific model number FPGA target
            * lvFpgaTarget - non-HDL files used to create custom LabVIEW FPGA target plugins
            * objects - generated file outputs from the HDL tools
                * gathereddeps - flat folder of dependencies copied from the root dependencies folder
                * LVTargetPlugin - custom LabVIEW FPGA target plugin files
