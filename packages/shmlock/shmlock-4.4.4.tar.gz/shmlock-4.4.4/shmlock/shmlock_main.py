        Experimental and not recommended to use in production code!

        add exit handlers to make sure lock is released if e.g. console is shut down or
        process is terminated via ctrl+c or similar and lock is still acquired.

        NOTE that there is still the possibility that the shared memory has been acquired but
        the process is terminated before the shared memory object has been returned.
