"""Propagation methods for optical wavefronts.

Extended Summary
----------------
Various propagation algorithms for simulating optical field propagation
through different media and materials. Includes lens-based propagation,
material-based propagation, free-space propagation, and high-NA vector
focusing methods.

Submodules
----------
free_space_prop
    Free-space propagation functions using scalar diffraction theory
material_prop
    Material propagation functions for sliced material models
vector_focusing
    High-NA vector focusing using Richards-Wolf diffraction integrals

Routine Listings

aplanatic_apodization : function
    Apply sqrt(cos(theta)) apodization for aplanatic lens systems.
compute_focal_volume : function
    Compute 3D focal volume at multiple z planes.
correct_propagator : function
    Automatically selects the most appropriate propagation method.
debye_wolf_focus : function
    Compute focal field using Debye-Wolf formulation.
digital_zoom : function
    Digital zoom transformation for optical fields.
fraunhofer_prop : function
    Fraunhofer (far-field) propagation.
fraunhofer_prop_scaled : function
    Fraunhofer propagation with output at specified pixel size.
fresnel_prop : function
    Fresnel (near-field) propagation.
high_na_focus : function
    Compute focal field using Richards-Wolf vector diffraction integrals.
lens_propagation : function
    Propagate optical wavefront through a lens.
multislice_propagation : function
    Propagate optical wavefront through a 3D material.
optical_path_length : function
    Compute the optical path length through a material.

    Compute the total transmission through a material.

Notes
-----
All propagation functions are JAX-compatible and support automatic
differentiation. The module is designed to be extensible for new
propagation methods.
