    description: |
      > CrateDB is a distributed and scalable SQL database for storing and analyzing massive amounts of data in near real-time, even with complex queries. It is based on Lucene, inherits technologies from Elasticsearch, and is compatible with PostgreSQL.

      Things to remember when working with CrateDB are:

      - CrateDB is a distributed database written in Java, where individual nodes form a database cluster, using a shared-nothing architecture.
      - CrateDB brings together fundamental components to manage big data after the Hadoop and Spark batch-processing era, more like Teradata, BigQuery and Snowflake are doing it.
      - Clients can connect to CrateDB using HTTP or the PostgreSQL wire protocol.
      - The default TCP ports of CrateDB are 4200 for the HTTP interface and 5432 for the PostgreSQL interface.
      - The language of choice after connecting to CrateDB is to use SQL, mostly compatible with PostgreSQL's SQL dialect.
      - The data storage layer is based on Lucene, the data distribution layer was inspired by Elasticsearch.
      - Storage concepts of CrateDB include partitioning and sharding to manage data larger than fitting on a single machine.
      - CrateDB Cloud offers a managed option for running CrateDB and provides additional features like automated backups, data ingest / ETL utilities, or scheduling recurrent jobs.
      - Get started with CrateDB Cloud at `https://console.cratedb.cloud`.
      - CrateDB also provides an option to run it on your premises, optimally by using its Docker/OCI image `docker.io/crate`. Nightly images are available per `docker.io/crate/crate:nightly`.

    # General information
    - title: "CrateDB reference: Partitioned tables"
      description: |
        A partitioned table is a virtual table consisting of zero or more partitions.
        A partition is similar to a regular single table and consists of one or more shards.
        A table becomes a partitioned table by defining partition columns.
        When a record with a new distinct combination of values for the configured partition
        columns is inserted, a new partition is created, and the document is inserted into this new partition.

    - title: "CrateDB reference: Storage"
      description: |
        Data storage options can be tuned for each column similar to how indexing is defined.
        Using the Column Store limits the values of TEXT columns to a maximal length of 32766 bytes.
        Turning off the Column Store in conjunction with turning off indexing will remove the length limitation.

    - title: "CrateDB reference: Replication"
      description: |
        You can configure CrateDB to replicate tables. When you configure replication, CrateDB will
        try to ensure that every table shard has one or more copies available at all times.
        This ensures data resiliency when individual cluster nodes go offline for maintenance.

        Views are stored named queries which can be used in place of table names.
        They’re resolved at runtime and can be used to simplify common queries.

        CrateDB has a built-in superuser account (`crate`) which has the privilege to do anything.
        The privileges of other users and roles have to be managed using the `GRANT`, `DENY` or `REVOKE` statements.
        The privileges that can be granted, denied or revoked are: `DQL`, `DML`, `DDL`, `AL`.
        The privileges can be granted on different classes: `CLUSTER`, `SCHEMA`, `TABLE`, `VIEW`.

      description: |
        Multi-tenancy is an architecture in which different tenants share a single software instance.
        CrateDB does not support the creation of multiple databases and catalogs as some other solutions
        (e.g., PostgreSQL). However, there are several ways to implement multi-tenancy in CrateDB, and,
        as is often the case, which one works the best depends on a variety of options and trade-offs.
        The article illustrates two methods for sharing a single CrateDB instance between multiple tenants.

        The REROUTE command provides various options to manually control the allocation of shards.
        It allows the enforcement of explicit allocations, cancellations and the moving of shards
        between nodes in a cluster, giving you the ability to re-balance the cluster state manually.

        a table is created using the CREATE TABLE statement.
        Data types play a central role as they limit what kind of data can be inserted and how it is stored.
        They also influence the behaviour when the records are queried.

        CrateDB from the Python ecosystem. It is verified to work with CPython, but it has also been tested
        successfully with PyPy.

        Psycopg 3 is a newly designed PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.
        Psycopg 3 presents a familiar interface for everyone who has used Psycopg 2 or any other DB-API 2.0 database
        adapter, but allows to use more modern PostgreSQL and Python features, such as:
        Asynchronous support, COPY support from Python objects, A redesigned connection pool, Support for static typing,
        Server-side parameters binding, Prepared statements, Statements pipeline, Binary communication,
        Direct access to the libpq functionalities.
        The basic Psycopg usage is common to all the database adapters implementing the DB-API protocol.
        Other database adapters, such as the builtin sqlite3 or psycopg2, have roughly the same pattern of interaction.
