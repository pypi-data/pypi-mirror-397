#### libcasm-clexulator

The libcasm-clexulator package is the CASM cluster expansion calculator (clexulator) module. This includes:

- A data structure (`ConfigDoFValues`) for representing degrees of freedom (DoF) in
  a configuration
- Neighbor list generation
- Methods for evaluating cluster expansion basis functions and cluster expansion values
- Methods for evaluating order parameters

This package does not include cluster expansion basis function generation, but uses basis functions that have been generated elsewhere (i.e. `casm bset`) and written as CASM Clexulator source code.


#### Install

    pip install libcasm-clexulator


#### Usage

See the [libcasm docs](https://prisms-center.github.io/CASMcode_pydocs/libcasm/overview/latest/).


#### About CASM
