This release also includes API documentation for using libcasm.composition, built using Sphinx.

### Added

- Added JSON IO for composition::CompositionConverter
- Added Python package libcasm.composition to use CASM composition converter and calculation methods.
- Added scikit-build, CMake, and pybind11 build process
- Added GitHub Actions for unit testing
- Added GitHub Action build_wheels.yml for Python x86_64 wheel building using cibuildwheel
- Added Cirrus-CI .cirrus.yml for Python aarch64 and arm64 wheel building using cibuildwheel
- Added Python documentation


### Removed
