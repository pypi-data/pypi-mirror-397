## Conformal Anomaly Detection

Thresholds for anomaly detection are often arbitrary and lack theoretical guarantees. **nonconform** wraps anomaly detectors (from [PyOD](https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), scikit-learn, or custom implementations) and transforms their raw anomaly scores into statistically valid *p*-values. It applies principles from [conformal prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_prediction) to [one-class classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-class_classification), enabling anomaly detection with provable statistical guarantees and a controlled [false discovery rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate).

> **Note:** The methods in **nonconform** assume that training and test data are [*exchangeable*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_random_variables) [Vovk et al., 2005]. Therefore, the package is not suited for data with spatial or temporal autocorrelation unless such dependencies are explicitly handled in preprocessing or model design.


# :hatching_chick: Getting Started

Installation via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nonconform/):
```sh
pip install nonconform
```

> **Note:** The following examples use an external dataset API. Install with `pip install oddball` or `pip install "nonconform[data]"` to include it. (see [Optional Dependencies](#optional-dependencies))


## Classical (Conformal) Approach

**Example:** Detecting anomalies with Isolation Forest on the Shuttle dataset. The approach splits data for calibration, trains the model, then converts anomaly scores to p-values by comparing test scores against the calibration distribution.

```python
from pyod.models.iforest import IForest
from scipy.stats import false_discovery_control

from nonconform import ConformalDetector, Split, false_discovery_rate, statistical_power
from oddball import Dataset, load

x_train, x_test, y_test = load(Dataset.SHUTTLE, setup=True, seed=42)

detector = ConformalDetector(
    detector=IForest(behaviour="new"),
    strategy=Split(n_calib=1_000),
    seed=42,
)
detector.fit(x_train)

p_values = detector.predict(x_test)
decisions = false_discovery_control(p_values, method="bh") <= 0.2

print(f"Empirical FDR: {false_discovery_rate(y_test, decisions)}")
print(f"Statistical Power: {statistical_power(y_test, decisions)}")
```

Output:
```text
Empirical FDR: 0.18
Statistical Power: 0.99
```

# :hatched_chick: Advanced Methods

Two advanced approaches are implemented that may increase the power of a conformal anomaly detector:
- A KDE-based (probabilistic) approach that models the calibration scores to achieve continuous *p*-values in contrast to the standard empirical distribution function.
- A weighted approach that prioritizes calibration scores by their similarity to the test batch at hand and is more robust to covariate shift between test and calibration data (can be combined with the probabilistic approach).

Probabilistic Conformal Approach:

```python
from pyod.models.iforest import IForest

from nonconform import ConformalDetector, Split, Probabilistic

detector = ConformalDetector(
    detector=IForest(behaviour="new"),
    strategy=Split(n_calib=1_000),
    estimation=Probabilistic(n_trials=10),
    seed=42,
)
```

Weighted Conformal Anomaly Detection:

```python
from pyod.models.iforest import IForest

from nonconform import ConformalDetector, Split, logistic_weight_estimator

detector = ConformalDetector(
    detector=IForest(behaviour="new"),
    strategy=Split(n_calib=1_000),
    weight_estimator=logistic_weight_estimator(),
    seed=42,
)
```

> **Note:** Weighted procedures require weighted FDR control for statistical validity (see ``weighted_false_discovery_control()``). Note that ``weighted_bh()`` often offers greater statistical power but has no strict statistical guarantees.


# Beyond Static Data

While primarily designed for static (single-batch) applications, the optional `onlinefdr` dependency provides FDR control methods appropriate for streaming scenarios.


# Custom Detectors

Any detector implementing the `AnomalyDetector` protocol works with nonconform:

```python
class MyDetector:
    def fit(self, X, y=None) -> Self: ...
    def decision_function(self, X) -> np.ndarray: ...  # higher = more anomalous
    def get_params(self, deep=True) -> dict: ...
    def set_params(self, **params) -> Self: ...
```

See [Detector Compatibility](user_guide/detector_compatibility.md) for details and examples.
