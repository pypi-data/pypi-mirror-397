I gave what I called an informal presentation to select sr technical leadership on the new design approach.
Presentation was a disaster.

Completely missed the mark. Questions and points raised clearly showed the bigger picture was lost on the audience.

Some members of the audience became defensive, which is understandable as what I am presenting challenges their design, which in myu opinion repeats many of the mistakes I am attempting to address.

Audience questions were fucused on shallow aspects.
There does not appear to be a clear understanding of framework vs business logic - the audience does not seem to grasp the difference.
A concise example of this:
I am proposing that all business logic reside together for a clear contextual view.
Some of this logic includes measuring data quality. Each business logic has different DQ requirements.
Som audience members were concerned about how to not trigger exceptions when DQ failures are observed, or on how to recover a job without rerunning the entire job. In my opinion these are business logic concerns, not framework concerns.
It is a very important distinction which was lost on the conversation



focus seems to be very shallow - they don't seem to grasp or acknowledge some of the bigger problems. Perhaps they do not actually encounter them since they are at higher level?


I thoroughly understand the problem, but I did not prepare well enough and I did not understand the audience.

CARL was completely wrong format.
But I did not approach the problem correctly.

Better approach would have been:
What is the problem I encountered?
What are some possible solutions?
How did I go about solving it?
Perhaps adding in some backing philosophy and/or experiences that rove this solution.

I should have done this for each problem/area.


I need to draft an email acknowledging my mistake and apologizing for the presentation.
Let them know I will regroup and approach from a different angle.



GPT4.1:
Your analysis is correct: the CARL format (Context, Action, Result, Learning) is comprehensive but can obscure the direct problem-solution narrative that technical audiences prefer. Based on your notes and the attached presentation, a more effective approach would be a "Problem → Solution → Implementation → Impact" structure for each major area.

Recommended Presentation Structure:

<hr></hr>
1. Introduction
Briefly state the overall challenge: "Current DWH business logic is complex, hard to maintain, and slows delivery."
<hr></hr>
2. Problem-Solution Breakdown (Repeat for each major area)
A. Architecture Complexity
Problem: Multi-repository, multi-system workflows create coordination overhead and debugging pain. Solution: Unified framework with single repository, platform abstraction, and schema-centric design. Implementation: Show before/after DAGs, repository structure, and configuration transparency. Impact: Faster onboarding, reduced debugging time, easier schema changes.


B. Testing & Quality
Problem: Limited test coverage, production issues, manual validation. Solution: Three-tier testing (unit, functional, integration) with automated schema validation. Implementation: Demo local test run, show schema validation catching errors pre-production. Impact: 95% coverage, fewer production issues, confidence in changes.


C. Knowledge Preservation
Problem: Business logic and context lost with team changes; onboarding is slow. Solution: Knowledge repository with self-documenting business rules and rationale. Implementation: Show code annotation example, explain how context is captured. Impact: Institutional memory survives, junior devs can contribute, faster ramp-up.


D. Delivery Bottlenecks
Problem: Permission bottlenecks and slow development cycles. Solution: Local development, platform independence, instant rollback/version management. Implementation: Demo local run, show version switching, highlight no MWAA changes needed. Impact: 50% faster feature delivery, innovation enabled, risk minimized.

<hr></hr>
3. Migration Strategy
Problem: Fear of rewrite, risk, and disruption.
Solution: Three-phase migration: zero-risk deployment, strategic migration, complete migration.
Implementation: Timeline, rollback demo, training plan.
Impact: Preserves investment, minimal risk, proven process.
<hr></hr>
4. Results & Metrics
Quantified benefits: debugging time, test coverage, production issues, onboarding speed.
Success metrics for Phase 1 and overall migration.
<hr></hr>
5. Call to Action
Approve framework deployment and begin Phase 1 migration.
<hr></hr> Why this works:
This format makes each area actionable, relatable, and easy to follow. It directly addresses pain points, shows the solution, and proves value with concrete examples and metrics.

You can use the slides and code examples from your original presentation, but organize them under these headings for each problem area. This will make your message clearer and more persuasive to technical leadership.
