NuExtract Platform

 NB: you can also interact with this API via the [Python SDK](https://github.com/numindai/nuextract-platform-sdk).  ## Extracting Information from Documents  Once your project is ready, you can use it to extract information from documents in real time via this RESTful API.  Each project has its own extraction endpoint:  `https://nuextract.ai/api/projects/{projectId}/extract`  You provide it a document and it returns the extracted information according to the task defined in the project. To use it, you need:  - To create an API key in the [Account section](https://nuextract.ai/app/user?content=api) - To replace `{projectId}` by the project ID found in the API tab of the project  You can test your extraction endpoint in your terminal using this command-line example with curl (make sure that you replace values of `PROJECT_ID` and `NUEXTRACT_API_KEY`):  ```bash NUEXTRACT_API_KEY=\"_your_api_key_here_\"; \\ PROJECT_ID=\"a24fd84a-44ab-4fd4-95a9-bebd46e4768b\"; \\ curl \"https://nuextract.ai/api/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/extract\" \\   -X POST \\   -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${NUEXTRACT_API_KEY}\" \\   -H \"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\" \\   --data-binary @\"${FILE_NAME}\" ```  You can also use the [Python SDK](https://github.com/numindai/nuextract-platform-sdk#documentation), by replacing the `project_id`, `api_key` and `file_path` variables in the following code:  ```python from numind import NuMind from pathlib import Path  client = NuMind(api_key=api_key) file_path = Path(\"path\", \"to\", \"document.odt\") with file_path.open(\"rb\") as file:     input_file = file.read() output_schema = client.post_api_projects_projectid_extract(project_id, input_file) ```  ## Using the Platform via API  Everything you can do on the web platform can be done via API -  check the [user guide](https://www.notion.so/User-Guide-17c16b1df8c580d3a579ebfb24ddbea7?pvs=21) to learn about how the platform works.  This can be useful to create projects automatically, or to make your production more robust for example.  ### Main resources  - **Project** - user project, identified by `projectId` - **File** - uploaded file,  identified by `fileId`, stored up to two weeks if not tied to an **Example** - **Document** - internal representation of a document, identified by `documentId`, created from a File or a text, stored up to two weeks if not tied to an Example - **Example** - document-extraction pair given to teach NuExtract, identified by `exampleId`, created from a Document  ### Most common API operations  - Creating a **Project** via `POST /api/projects` - Changing the template of a **Project** via `PATCH /api/projects/{projectId}` - Uploading a file to a **File** via `POST /api/files` (up to 2 weeks storage) - Creating a **Document** via `POST /api/documents/text` and `POST /api/files/{fileID}/convert-to-document` from a text or a **File** - Adding an **Example** to a **Project** via `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/examples` - Changing Project settings via `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/settings` - Locking a **Project** via `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/lock`  ## Testing with a temporary authorization  This documentation allows to directly test the API. You first need to select `oauth2uth` in the \"Authentication\" box, set the `Client ID` value to `user`, and click on \"Authorize\". You can then go to an API endpoint, e.g.  `POST /api/{projectID}/extract`, press “Test Request”, fill out the body (you can upload a document in this case), and press “Send” to get the output.
