# Popoto-API
Python implimentation of the Popoto-API
# Installing package from gitlab
To install the from the gitlab pypi package repository follow these steps:
## Create an acess token
1. Go to your gitlab profile settings
2. Click on "Access Tokens"
3. Create a new access token with the following scopes:
   - `read_api`
   - `read_repository`
   - `read_package_registry`
4. Copy the access token, you will need it later.
## Create a pip configuration file
Create a file named `pip.conf` in your home directory (e.g., `~/.pip/pip.conf` on Linux/MacOS or `%APPDATA%\pip\pip.conf` on Windows) and add the following content:
```ini
[global]
index-url = https://__token__:<your_access_token>@gitlab.popotomodem.com/api/v4/projects/134/packages/pypi/simple
```
## Install the package
Now you can install the package using pip:

For the latest version:
```bash
pip install popoto-api
```

For a specific version:
```bash
pip install popoto-api==<version>
```

Example:
```bash
pip install popoto-api
# or for a specific version
pip install popoto-api==0.0.1+seng333.7343
```
## Data server CLI
The install also provides the Popoto data server entry point:
```bash
popoto-data-server --listen-port 39484
```
# Development
To contribute to the project, you can clone the repository and devolop locally or in the included dev container.
## Cloning the repository
```bash
git clone git@gitlab.popotomodem.com:delresearch/api/pythonpopotoapi.git
```
## Setting up the development environment
You can use the included dev container for development. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the "Dev Containers" extension if you haven't already.
3. A notification should appear asking if you want to reopen the repository in a container. Click "Reopen in Container". **Note**: If the notification does not appear, you can manually open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and select "Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container".
4. Wait for the container to build and start.
   **Note**: If there are any issues with the container build, it's usually related to the mounts in the `devcontainer.json` file. Make sure you have a .ssh directory in your home directory, and a .gitconfig file in your home directory.
5. Once the container is running, you can open a terminal in the container and run the following command to install the package in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
### Note for commits
