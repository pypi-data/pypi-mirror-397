## OMNISOOT
Omnisoot is an object-oriented computational tool for the simulation of the gas phase synthesis of nanoparticles including soot (Carbon Black), graphene, nickel, and carbon nanotubes in reactors. Omnisoot can be used for scientific research or process design and optimization of commercial reactors. It accommodates a variety of particle dynamics, inception, growth, and oxidation models that can be combined and used for target simulations in Plug Flow, Constant Volume, Partially Stirred, and Pressure reactors. Reaction mechanisms are processed by [Cantera](https://cantera.org/) that is used to compute thermodynamic and kinetics properties of the gas mixture. A series of examples are also available in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts [here](https://github.com/mohammadadib-cu/omnisoot-cv).
Omnisoot has been registered for copyright on 31 May 2023 by [Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO)](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/business/ip.html) under regirstration number 1203139.
