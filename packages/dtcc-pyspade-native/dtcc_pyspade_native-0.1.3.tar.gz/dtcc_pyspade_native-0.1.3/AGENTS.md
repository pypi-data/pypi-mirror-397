# Agent Workflow Note

For any task in this repository:
- The assisting agent must consult the Context7 MCP server for relevant best practices and documentation before executing key steps or providing recommendations.
- If the agent cannot connect to the Context7 MCP server, it must explicitly complain about the failure and note that the required guidance could not be retrieved.
- Always use line comments and not block comments on the header of source files.
