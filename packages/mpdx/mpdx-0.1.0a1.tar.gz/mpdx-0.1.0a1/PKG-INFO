# MPDX — Multi-Parent Document Exchange

MPDX is a **semantic, graph-based document data model** for representing textual and tabular documents independently of visual layout.

Rather than encoding documents as trees or grid coordinates, MPDX models documents as **meaning-centered semantic graphs**, enabling the same document semantics to be rendered, queried, analyzed, and reused across multiple forms.

This repository provides the **reference specification, examples, and minimal tooling** for MPDX.

---

## Motivation

Most existing document formats—such as DOCX, HTML, and spreadsheets—encode documents as:

- Tree-based structures (DOM, XML)
- Row–column–oriented tables
- Layout-driven representations

While effective for rendering, these approaches make it difficult to:

- Explicitly represent **semantic relationships** between document elements
- Reuse document meaning across different layouts
- Apply documents directly to automation, analysis, or LLM-based processing

In particular, **tabular data is usually defined by coordinates**, not by meaning.  
A cell is typically identified as “row × column,” even when its true meaning is a semantic combination (e.g., *planned amount* × *student labor*).

MPDX addresses this limitation by modeling documents as **semantic graphs with multi-parent relationships**, where values are defined by **semantic intersections**, not fixed positions.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Semantic Graph Model

- All document elements are represented as **nodes**
- Nodes may have **multiple parents**, enabling semantic intersections
- The model is not constrained to tree structures

This allows document meaning to be expressed directly, rather than inferred from layout.

---

### 2. Minimal Node Types

MPDX intentionally defines a small, extensible set of node types:

| Type    | Description                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `table` | Root node representing a document or table       |
| `title` | Title of a document or table                     |
| `t`     | Semantic text node (headers, labels, categories) |
| `v`     | Value node representing a semantic intersection  |

---

### 3. Values as Semantic Intersections

In MPDX, a value is not defined as “row × column,” but as the intersection of multiple semantic dimensions.

**Example:**

- Parent A: *Student Labor*
- Parent B: *Planned Amount*

→ The resulting value represents:  
**“Planned amount of student labor”**

This interpretation is independent of how the table is visually arranged.

---

## MPDX Serialization

MPDX can be serialized using simple, human-readable, text-based formats.

This repository includes a **TSV-based reference serialization**:

- Each row represents a node
- Parent relationships are explicitly listed
- Designed as an **intermediate representation**, not a final rendering format

**Example:**

```text
id parents type text
1 0 table
2 1 title Simple Budget Example
3 2 t Category
4 2 t Item
5 2 t Planned Amount
10 3 t Direct Cost
11 [10,4] t Student Labor
12 [11,5] v 19260
````

The serialization format is only one possible representation.
**MPDX as a model is not tied to any specific file format.**

---

## Rendering Independence

A key property of MPDX is the separation of **meaning** and **rendering**.

The same MPDX data can be rendered as:

- Hierarchical tables with merged cells
- Fully flattened analytical tables
- Pivoted or transposed views
- Database-friendly representations

All of these are different projections of the same underlying semantic model.

---

## Use Cases

- Document automation and transformation
- Complex table modeling (budgets, reports, forms)
- LLM-friendly document structuring
- Semantic document analysis
- Intermediate representation between authoring and rendering
- Database-backed document systems

---

## Project Status

MPDX is currently in an **early, research-oriented stage**.

- The core data model is stable enough for experimentation
- Reference serialization and examples are provided
- Tooling is intentionally minimal

This repository is published to:

- Establish the conceptual model
- Enable discussion and early adoption
- Support academic reference and extension
