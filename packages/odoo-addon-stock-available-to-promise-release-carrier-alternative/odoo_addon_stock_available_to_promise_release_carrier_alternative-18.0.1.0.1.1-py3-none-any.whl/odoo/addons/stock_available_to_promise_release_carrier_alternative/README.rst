Configuration
=============

Go to any delivery method in order to define its alternative delivery
methods.

At release, a new carrier might be selected among alternative carriers.
This has to comply with a few rules, such as carrier max weight and
volume. You also can add extra rules by editing a delivery method's
Picking Domain.
