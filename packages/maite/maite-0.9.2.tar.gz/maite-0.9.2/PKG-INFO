MAITE is a library of common types, protocols (a.k.a. structural subtypes), and utilities for the test and evaluation (T&E) of supervised machine learning models. It is being developed under the [Joint AI T&E Infrastructure Capability (JATIC)](https://gitlab.jatic.net/home/) program. Its goal is to streamline the development of JATIC Python projects by ensuring seamless, synergistic workflows when working with MAITE-conforming Python packages for different T&E tasks. To this end, MAITE seeks to eliminate redundancies that would otherwise be shared across – and burden – separate efforts in machine learning test and evaluation. MAITE is designed to be a low-dependency, frequently-improved Python package that is installed by JATIC projects. The following is a brief overview of the current state of its submodules.

## Installation

### From Python Package Index (PyPI)
To install from the Python Package Index (PyPI), run:

```console
pip install maite
```

> :information_source: You can install MAITE for a given release tag, e.g. `v0.6.1`, by running:
>
>```console
>$ pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/mit-ll-ai-technology/maite.git@v0.6.1
>```

### From Source

To clone this repository and install from source, run:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/mit-ll-ai-technology/maite
$ cd maite
$ pip install .
```

## maite.protocols

*Common types for machine learning test and evaluation*

The `protocols` subpackage defines common types – such as an inference-mode object detector – to be leveraged across JATIC projects. These are specifically designed to be [Python protocol classes](https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/), which support structural subtyping. As a result, developers and users can satisfy MAITE-typed interfaces without having to explicitly subclass. This ability helps to promote common interfaces across JATIC projects without introducing explicit inter-dependencies between them.

### Pyright Static Type Checking in Code

```python
>>> def f(x: str):
...     return 1 + x
>>> pyright_analyze(f)
{'version': '1.1.281',
  'time': '1669686515154',
  'generalDiagnostics': [{'file': 'source.py',
    'severity': 'error',
    'message': 'Operator "+" not supported for types "Literal[1]" and "str"\n\xa0\xa0Operator "+" not supported for types "Literal[1]" and "str"',
    'range': {'start': {'line': 1, 'character': 11},
    'end': {'line': 1, 'character': 16}},
    'rule': 'reportGeneralTypeIssues'}],
  'summary': {'filesAnalyzed': 20,
  'errorCount': 1,
  'warningCount': 0,
  'informationCount': 0,
  'timeInSec': 0.319}}
```

## maite.utils

*General utilities*

- Functions for validating the types and values of user arguments, with explicit and consistent user-error messages, that raise MAITE-customized exceptions.
- Specialized PyTorch utilities to help facilitate safe and ergonomic code patterns for manipulating stateful torch objects
- Other quality assurance and convenience functions that may be widely useful across projects
