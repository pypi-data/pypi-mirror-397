GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a
computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
if it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License,
and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a
user to interact with, it must do so in a manner that causes the
required notices to be conspicuous, including when the user starts the
program, if the user can run a modified version of the program.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of
a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if
the work is an executable) or a compiler (if the work is a library).

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are
not part of the work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights to make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license remains in force.

  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
designate a third party recipient.  Those thus making or running the
covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes
discretionary except under this License.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
law.  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to impose
any condition on the exercise of the rights granted under this License
for the benefit of another party or for the benefit of yourself if you
convey the work to that party.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
    under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This
    requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact
    all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, this requirement applies only
    to the user interfaces that you create.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or by the act of compiling, is called an "aggregate" if the
compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the
access or legal rights of the other parts of the aggregate beyond what
the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the
aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
    used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product,
    to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of
    the Corresponding Source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This is
    allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
    received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
    subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place ("clear enough"), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    charge to everyone who obtains the object code there.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source are being offered to the public, at no charge under the
    terms of this License.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying a covered work.  A "User Product" is either (1)

  a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property
which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or
  (2) anything that is designed or sold for incorporation into a
customer product.  Examples include, but are not limited to, units of a
home appliance, a digital set-top box, a portable music player, a
cellular telephone, a personal computer, an industrial control
system, an embedded microprocessor, or a home automation device.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a User Product means all the source
code needed to install and run a covered work contained in the User
Product, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the
scripts used to control compilation and installation of the covered
work, plus any necessary implied dependencies that accompany the
covered work.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are consistent with the terms of this License.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your discretion
add additional permissions, provided that you do not put any
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted by this
License.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any rights granted by any additional terms).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurs when neither party is aware of the other's copy, or when the
copying is for the sole purpose of passing on the work to someone who
has not received it.

  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to
propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions are prohibited by
law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or
propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this
License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  If you convey a covered work in object code form, then you must also
convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of
this License.

  11. Patents.

  A "patent license" from a contributor is a patent license
granted by such contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import
and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its
contributions, where such a license applies only to the
contributions.  Patent licenses accompanying a work may be set forth
in the source code or within a notice accompanying the work.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
you must either (1) make a good-faith effort to bring to the
attention of the appropriate copyright holders the fact that you are
using their patented material, or (2) secure the patent license itself
or the undertaking that you will be able to satisfy the license.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  For example, if you
agree to reimburse someone for their legal expenses in enforcing a
patent license, you are not thereby excused from complying with this
License.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, provided that the combination satisfies the requirements
of both licenses.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program does not specify a version number, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, review
these terms in light of the overall purpose of sections 15 and 16.

                            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
if you attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
this much notice.  Replace "<one line to give the program's name and a
brief idea of what it does." with the name of the actual program, and
replace the second blank with the year.  Replace "<name of author>" with
your name, or the name of the entity that owns the program.

      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
  the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
  (at your option) any later version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
  GNU General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
  along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
