        List runs of a Workflow. Workflows are sequences of steps that process files and data in a specific order to achieve a desired outcome. A WorkflowRun represents a single execution of a workflow against a file.

        Parameters
        ----------
        status : typing.Optional[WorkflowStatus]
            Filters workflow runs by their status. If not provided, no filter is applied.

             The status of a workflow run:
             * `"PENDING"` - The workflow run has not started yet
             * `"PROCESSING"` - The workflow run is in progress
             * `"NEEDS_REVIEW"` - The workflow run requires manual review
             * `"REJECTED"` - The workflow run was rejected during manual review
             * `"PROCESSED"` - The workflow run completed successfully
             * `"FAILED"` - The workflow run encountered an error
             * `"CANCELLED"` - The workflow run was cancelled
             * `"CANCELLING"` - The workflow run is being cancelled

        workflow_id : typing.Optional[str]
            Filters workflow runs by the workflow ID. If not provided, runs for all workflows are returned.

            Example: `"workflow_BMdfq_yWM3sT-ZzvCnA3f"`

        batch_id : typing.Optional[str]
            Filters workflow runs by the batch ID. This is useful for fetching all runs for a given batch created via the [Batch Run Workflow](/developers/api-reference/workflow-endpoints/batch-run-workflow) endpoint.

            Example: `"batch_7Ws31-F5"`

        file_name_contains : typing.Optional[str]
            Filters workflow runs by the name of the file. Only returns workflow runs where the file name contains this string.

            Example: `"invoice"`

        sort_by : typing.Optional[SortByEnum]
            Sorts the workflow runs by the given field.

        sort_dir : typing.Optional[SortDirEnum]
            Sorts the workflow runs in ascending or descending order. Ascending order means the earliest workflow run is returned first.

        next_page_token : typing.Optional[NextPageToken]

        max_page_size : typing.Optional[MaxPageSize]

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.

        Returns
        -------
        WorkflowRunListResponse
            You will get a list of summaries for each workflow run. These are shortened versions of the full WorkflowRun object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        workflow_id : str
            The ID of the workflow to run.

            Example: `"workflow_BMdfq_yWM3sT-ZzvCnA3f"`

        files : typing.Optional[typing.Sequence[WorkflowRunFileInput]]
            An array of files to process through the workflow. Either the `files` array or `rawTexts` array must be provided. Supported file types can be found [here](/product/general/supported-file-types). There is a limit if 50 files that can be processed at once using this endpoint. If you wish to process more at a time, consider using the [Batch Run Workflow](/developers/api-reference/workflow-endpoints/batch-run-workflow) endpoint.

        raw_texts : typing.Optional[typing.Sequence[str]]
            An array of raw strings. Can be used in place of files when passing raw data. The raw data will be converted to `.txt` files and run through the workflow. If the data follows a specific format, it is recommended to use the files parameter instead. Either `files` or `rawTexts` must be provided.

        version : typing.Optional[str]
            An optional version of the workflow that files will be run through. This number can be found when viewing the workflow on the Extend platform. When a version number is not supplied, the most recent published version of the workflow will be used. If no published versions exist, the draft version will be used. To run the `"draft"` version of a workflow, use `"draft"` as the version.

            Examples:
            - `"3"` - Run version 3 of the workflow
            - `"draft"` - Run the draft version of the workflow

        priority : typing.Optional[int]
            An optional value used to determine the relative order of WorkflowRuns when rate limiting is in effect. Lower values will be prioritized before higher values.

        metadata : typing.Optional[JsonObject]
            An optional metadata object that can be assigned to a specific WorkflowRun to help identify it. It will be returned in the response and webhooks. You can place any arbitrary `key : value` pairs in this object.

            To categorize workflow runs for billing and usage tracking, include `extend:usage_tags` with an array of string values (e.g., `{"extend:usage_tags": ["production", "team-eng", "customer-123"]}`). Tags must contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores; any special characters will be automatically removed.

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.

        Run a Workflow with files. A Workflow is a sequence of steps that process files and data in a specific order to achieve a desired outcome. A WorkflowRun will be created for each file processed. A WorkflowRun represents a single execution of a workflow against a file.

        Parameters
        ----------
        workflow_id : str
            The ID of the workflow to run.

            Example: `"workflow_BMdfq_yWM3sT-ZzvCnA3f"`

        files : typing.Optional[typing.Sequence[WorkflowRunFileInput]]
            An array of files to process through the workflow. Either the `files` array or `rawTexts` array must be provided. Supported file types can be found [here](/product/general/supported-file-types). There is a limit if 50 files that can be processed at once using this endpoint. If you wish to process more at a time, consider using the [Batch Run Workflow](/developers/api-reference/workflow-endpoints/batch-run-workflow) endpoint.

        raw_texts : typing.Optional[typing.Sequence[str]]
            An array of raw strings. Can be used in place of files when passing raw data. The raw data will be converted to `.txt` files and run through the workflow. If the data follows a specific format, it is recommended to use the files parameter instead. Either `files` or `rawTexts` must be provided.

        version : typing.Optional[str]
            An optional version of the workflow that files will be run through. This number can be found when viewing the workflow on the Extend platform. When a version number is not supplied, the most recent published version of the workflow will be used. If no published versions exist, the draft version will be used. To run the `"draft"` version of a workflow, use `"draft"` as the version.

            Examples:
            - `"3"` - Run version 3 of the workflow
            - `"draft"` - Run the draft version of the workflow

        priority : typing.Optional[int]
            An optional value used to determine the relative order of WorkflowRuns when rate limiting is in effect. Lower values will be prioritized before higher values.

        metadata : typing.Optional[JsonObject]
            An optional metadata object that can be assigned to a specific WorkflowRun to help identify it. It will be returned in the response and webhooks. You can place any arbitrary `key : value` pairs in this object.

            To categorize workflow runs for billing and usage tracking, include `extend:usage_tags` with an array of string values (e.g., `{"extend:usage_tags": ["production", "team-eng", "customer-123"]}`). Tags must contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores; any special characters will be automatically removed.

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.
