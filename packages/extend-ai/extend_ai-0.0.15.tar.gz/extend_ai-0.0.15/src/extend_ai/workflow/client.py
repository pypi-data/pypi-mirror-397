        Create a new workflow in Extend. Workflows are sequences of steps that process files and data in a specific order to achieve a desired outcome.

        This endpoint will create a new workflow in Extend, which can then be configured and deployed. Typically, workflows are created from our UI, however this endpoint can be used to create workflows programmatically. Configuration of the flow still needs to be done in the dashboard.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            The name of the workflow

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.

        Returns
        -------
        WorkflowCreateResponse
            Successfully created workflow

        Examples
        --------
