## Project Overview

fabric-cicd is a Python library designed for use with [Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/) workspaces. This library supports code-first Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automations to seamlessly integrate Source Controlled workspaces into a deployment framework. The goal is to assist CI/CD developers who prefer not to interact directly with the Microsoft Fabric APIs.
