Improvement
===========

Node Repositioning
------------------

Node repositioning/mesh smoothing moves the nodes of a mesh with the goal of 
more evenly distributing nodes and/or improving element quality. Throughout 
the process, no nodes or elements are added/removed and the connectivity of the
elements doesn't change.

Topological Modifications

    edgecontract

The mesh topology (i.e. connectivity of the elements) can be modified to
improve mesh element quality.
Topological modifications include "flips" where adjacent elements that share a
face or an edge are reconnected in a new configuration, as well as edge 
contraction and splitting, which can be used to coarsen and refine a mesh, 
respectively.
