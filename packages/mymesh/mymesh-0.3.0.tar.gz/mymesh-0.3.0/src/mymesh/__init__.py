    Example mesh models from online databases
    
    Since data is obtained on-demand from online sources, internet connectivity 
    is required.

    The Stanford models (bunny, dragon, Lucy) are obtained from the 
    `Stanford Computer Graphics Library <https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/>`__.
    The following notices from the library's website apply to these models:

        Please be sure to acknowledge the source of the data and models you take 
        from this repository. In each of the listings below, we have cited the 
        source of the range data and reconstructed models. You are welcome to 
        use the data and models for research purposes. You are also welcome to 
        mirror or redistribute them for free. Finally, you may publish images 
        made using these models, or the images on this web site, in a scholarly
        article or book - as long as credit is given to the Stanford Computer 
        Graphics Laboratory. However, such models or images are not to be used 
        for commercial purposes, nor should they appear in a product for sale 
        (with the exception of scholarly journals or books), without our 
        permission. 

        As you browse this repository and think about how you might use our 3D 
        models and range datasets, please remember that several of these 
        artifacts have religious or cultural significance. Aside from the buddha, 
        which is a religious symbol revered by hundreds of millions of people, 
        the dragon is a symbol of Chinese culture, the Thai statue contains 
        elements of religious significance to Hindus, and Lucy is a Christian 
        angel; statues like her are commonly seen in Italian churches. Keep your 
        renderings and other uses of these particular models in good taste. 
        Don't animate or morph them, don't apply Boolean operators to them, and 
        don't simulate nasty things happening to them (like breaking, exploding, 
        melting, etc.). Choose another model for these sorts of experiments. 
        (You can do anything you want to the Stanford bunny or the armadillo.) 
    

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str, optional
        Name of the image to access, by default 'bunny'.
        Available options are:

        - "bunny" - Stanford Bunny from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository.
            - Coarser versions of the model are available as "bunny_res2", "bunny_res3", "bunny_res4"
            - This is a non-manifold surface, the mesh has several holes on the bottom

        - "dragon" - Stanford Dragon from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository 
            - Coarser versions of the model are available as "dragon_res2", "dragon_res3", "dragon_res4"
            - This is a non-manifold surface, the mesh has numerous small holes

        - "Lucy" - "Angel of Light" statue from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository
            - This surface is hole free but has some topological defects/bridging
    Returns
