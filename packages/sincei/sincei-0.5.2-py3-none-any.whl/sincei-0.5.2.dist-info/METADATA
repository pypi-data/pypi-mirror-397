## Features

sincei provides a flexible, easy-to-use command-line interface to work with single-cell data directly from BAM files. It can:

 - Aggregate signal in bins, genes or any feature of interest from single-cells.
 - Perform read-level and count-level quality control.
 - Perform dimensionality reduction and clustering of all kinds of single-cell data (open chromatin, histone marks, methylation, gene expression etc..).
 - Create coverage files (bigwigs) for visualization.

For details, please [**read our preprint**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.27.605424v1) describing sincei.

## [Full Documentation](http://sincei.rtfd.io/)

Please browse the full documentation for tutorials on how to use sincei on the command line, as well as details of our python API.

## Installation

sincei is a command line toolkit based on python3, and can be installed using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

The recommended way to install sincei is via bioconda:

```
conda create -n sincei -c bioconda -c conda-forge sincei
```

Alternatively, a development version can be installed via GitHub.

```
conda create -n sincei python=3.10
conda activate sincei
pip install --editable=git+https://github.com/bhardwaj-lab/sincei.git@develop#egg=sincei
```

## Usage

**Get the tool list with `sincei --help`**

Each tool begins with the prefix sc<tool_name>, such as:

```
scBulkCoverage -b file1.bam -g groupinfo.txt -o coverage
```
