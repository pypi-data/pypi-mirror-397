## Recommended Actions

1. **Start with Grade F items** - These have the highest complexity and are hardest to maintain
2. **Address Critical code smells** - God Classes and deeply nested code should be refactored
3. **Break down long methods** - Extract helper functions to reduce complexity
4. **Add tests before refactoring** - Ensure behavior is preserved
