``hsntools`` (formerly 'convnwb') is a module for working with the Human Single-Neuron Pipeline (HSNPipeline).

Overview
--------

This module contains general utilities for working with human single-neuron data and projects.

``hsntools`` is designed for use in the Human Single-Neuron pipeline, which provides a guide and
template structure for human single-neuron projects, including working with data files, converting
data to the `NWB <https://www.nwb.org/>`_ format, and managing projects and analyses.

Available sub-modules in `hsntools` include:

- ``io``: includes save and load functions and utilities for working with files raw and converted data files
- ``nsp``: includes functionality that relating to managing recording files from neural signal processors
- ``objects``: includes objects for storing relevant data, for example electrode or task related information
- ``paths``: includes a `Paths` object and utilities for defining and using a consistent path structure
- ``plts``: includes plot functions for examining data through the conversion process
- ``sorting``: includes functionality relating to managing spike sorting
- ``timestamps``: includes utilities for managing timestamps and aligning data streams
- ``utils``: includes general utilities for working with data through the conversion process

Scope
-----

The `hsntools` module is a helper module for implementing functionality needed for the
`Human Single-Neuron Pipeline`. It includes utilities related to managing and organizing relevant files,
including file I/O, functionality for organizing and aligning multiple data streams and converting
data to standardized data files, and utilities for assisting with running analyses across such data
and generating structured reports.

``hsntools`` provides functionality used within the template for the pipeline, including:

- `PrepTEMPLATE <https://github.com/HSNPipeline/PrepTEMPLATE>`_
- `ConvertTEMPLATE <https://github.com/HSNPipeline/ConvertTEMPLATE>`_
- `AnalyzeTEMPLATE <https://github.com/HSNPipeline/AnalyzeTEMPLATE>`_

Note that `hsntools` is not a module for and does not include functionality for spike sorting or single-neuron analyses.
See the `HSNPipeline Overview <https://github.com/HSNPipeline/Overview>`_ for information and guidance on these
processes and related tooling.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for the ``hsntools`` module is available
`here <https://hsnpipeline.github.io/hsntools/>`_

Documentation for the HSNPipeline more broadly, which uses ``hsntools`` is available on the
`pipeline website <https://hsnpipeline.github.io/>`_

If you have a question about using ``hsntools`` that doesn't seem to be covered by the documentation, feel free to
open an `issue <https://https://github.com/HSNPipeline/hsntools/issues>`_ and ask!

Dependencies
------------

``hsntools`` is written in Python, and requires Python >= 3.7 to run.

It has the following required dependencies:

- `numpy <https://github.com/numpy/numpy>`_
- `pyyaml <https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml>`_

There are also optional dependencies, that offer extra functionality:

- `pynwb <https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb>`_ is needed for validating NWB files
- `matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/>`_ is needed for making plots to check conversions
- `scikit-learn <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn>`_ is needed to aligning sync pulses
- `pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`_ is needed for utilities that load dataframes
- `scipy <https://github.com/scipy/scipy>`_ is needed for some load and timestamp related functions
- `h5py <https://github.com/h5py/h5py>`_ is needed for utilities that open HDF5 files
- `neo <https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/python-neo>`_ is needed for loading & interacting with NSP files
- `mat73 <https://github.com/skjerns/mat7.3>`_ is needed for loading .mat files version >= 7.3
- `pytest <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest>`_ is needed to run the test suite locally
