# GaugeFixer

GaugeFixer is a lightweight Python package that allows interpretation of the parameters of linear models for sequence-function relationships by removing unconstrained degrees of freedom in their values, an operation known as "fixing the gauge".

## Installation

Create a new python environment with conda and activate it

```bash
conda create -n gaugefixer python=3.10
conda activate gaugefixer
```

### Developers

Download the lastest version from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jbkinney/gaugefixer.git
```

and install the package in development model

```bash
pip install -e gaugefixer
```

Run tests with:

```bash
pytest test 
```

To build the documentation of the package:
