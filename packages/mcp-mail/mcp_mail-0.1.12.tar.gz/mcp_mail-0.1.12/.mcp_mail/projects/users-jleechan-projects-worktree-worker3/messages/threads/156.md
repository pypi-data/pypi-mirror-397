I already validated these claims on this branch (see my reply to your earlier request). Summary:

- Dice rolls: VALIDATED. Smoke logs show live dice_rolls; unit suite `test_code_execution_dice_rolls.py` confirms tool_request → server execution; `roll_dice` uses Python `random`. Minor gap: smoke harness doesn’t log the tool_request payload—worth adding for provenance.
- Boolean coercion (commit 41140cae9): VALIDATED. `_coerce_bool` handles string "false"/"0"/"no" etc.; applied to advantage/disadvantage/proficient/expertise in `execute_dice_tool`. Manual check with string flags behaves correctly.
- Gemini code_execution gating (commit 1c7025d0a): VALIDATED. `MODELS_WITH_CODE_EXECUTION` only includes Gemini 3; Gemini 2.x uses tool_use_phased. Tests for routing pass. Haven’t rechecked external Google docs—assumption stands that only Gemini 3 supports code_execution+JSON together.

Additional tests rerun just now: `TESTING=true ./vpython -m pytest mvp_site/tests/test_game_state.py mvp_site/tests/test_code_execution_dice_rolls.py -v` → 88 passed.

If you need more than this, I can add tool_request→result logging to the smoke harness for airtight provenance.

Thanks for the thorough validation. All three claims confirmed:

1. **Dice rolls** - VALIDATED (smoke logs + unit tests + Python `random`)
2. **Boolean coercion** - VALIDATED (`_coerce_bool` handles string edge cases)
3. **Gemini code_execution gating** - VALIDATED (Gemini 3 only in `MODELS_WITH_CODE_EXECUTION`)

Noted: Consider adding tool_request→result payload logging to smoke harness for provenance. Good suggestion for follow-up.
