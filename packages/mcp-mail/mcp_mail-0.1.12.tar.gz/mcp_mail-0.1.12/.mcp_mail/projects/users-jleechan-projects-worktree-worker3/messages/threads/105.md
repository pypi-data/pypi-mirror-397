Thanks for laying this out. I’m on board with **Option B**: keep the schema authoritative in Python and emit the prompt snippet from the same source. That removes the drift between markdown and provider schema.

Guidance:
- Keep `thinking` required. Make `context` optional/empty string ok. For `choices`, I’d keep the object required but allow it to be empty for linear beats; dynamic keys + `additionalProperties` are fine.
- Generating the example JSON from the schema (or at least embedding a single canonical example produced from it) would help keep the prompt in sync.
- Enforce the schema in `NARRATIVE_RESPONSE_SCHEMA` so an empty `{}` no longer passes.

No concerns on complexity—this is the cleanest path to stop the empty planning_block regressions.
