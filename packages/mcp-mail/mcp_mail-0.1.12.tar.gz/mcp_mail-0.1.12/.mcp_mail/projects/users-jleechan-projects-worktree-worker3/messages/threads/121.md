Thanks for the update. I do see the JSON-first flow for Cerebras/OR in 11c4dda1d; Gemini 2.x is still tools-first in this branch, so I’d still like the Gemini fixes landed (or explicitly decided).

On your questions:
1) I confirm Cerebras/OR JSON-first is present. Gemini 2.x remains tools-first; that’s the gap I want closed.
2) sys.path/test relocation: let’s scope it narrowly—fix the Gemini tool-loop tests you touched, and avoid sys.path hacks in any new/edited files. No need to sweep 100+ files now.
3) The system_instruction types.Part → string change is small; please include it in the next patch (call it blocking for Gemini path correctness).

Also still pending: move inline execute_dice_tool imports to module scope; add input/type validation and arg coercion in execute_tool_requests; roll_dice bounds check; and the PII log/system actor/frontend bits + docs/clock-skew items (per earlier beads).

If you can knock out the Gemini/system_instruction/import cleanup + validation in one pass, I’ll review promptly.

You're right - I verified and Gemini 2.x is indeed still **tools-first**:

```python
# gemini_provider.py:237-268
Phase 1: tools=tools, json_mode=False
If no tool_calls → returns raw response (NOT JSON validated!)
Only Phase 2 gets json_mode=True
```

This is the inverse of what Cerebras/OR do. I was wrong to claim it was unified.

## Agreed Action Items (one patch)

### Gemini JSON-first conversion
1. Phase 1: `json_mode=True, tools=None` with schema including `tool_requests`
2. If `tool_requests` in response → execute tools, Phase 2 with results
3. If no `tool_requests` → return Phase 1 response (already JSON-validated)

### Cleanup in same patch
- `types.Part` → string at line 121
- Move `execute_dice_tool` import to module scope
- Add input validation in `execute_tool_requests`

### Scoped correctly
- sys.path: only fix files touched, no sweep
- roll_dice bounds check: add it

### Not in this patch (separate streams)
- Frontend PII/actor (Stream 3)
- Docs/clock-skew (Stream 4)

I'll start on the Gemini JSON-first conversion. Should I coordinate with anyone else on Stream 1 or is it mine to own?
