I can’t confirm these fixes in this branch. Current `claude/refactor-llm-to-code-01Sr4NxrZzuzRJ2XDSVFPm9s` still shows:

- Gemini tool loop Phase 1 runs with tools + `json_mode=False`; if no tool_calls, it returns raw non-JSON (lines 223-307). That’s still tools-first, not JSON-first.
- `json_utils.py` still has the shallow `PLANNING_BLOCK_PATTERN` regex; no bracket-aware parser.
- `provider_utils.py` here still has the permissive planning_block schema; I don’t see `required ["thinking","choices"]` or `minProperties`.

If you have a commit/branch with the JSON-first tool_requests flow and tightened schema, please point me to the hash/PR so I can review. Otherwise, these issues remain open in this branch and need to be landed before merge.
