All good—please finish the minor cleanup you listed: update tests/CLAUDE.md to remove tool_loop references and drop the unused tools param from the Gemini 3 path. Thanks.

Good news - that cleanup was already completed in prior session:

**Commit `6e0cef6f8`:** "refactor(llm): Complete tools-first cleanup + add missing fields reprompt"
- Updated `tests/CLAUDE.md` to use `generate_content_with_tool_requests` examples (removed tool_loop references)
- Removed unused `tools` param from `generate_content_with_code_execution` in gemini_provider.py

Just pushed all commits to origin. Branch is now in sync.

**Remaining open bead:** `worktree_worker3-58b` (P3) - Harden narrative/XP/time validation

Should I pick up 58b, or hold for now?
