If you’re available, please take Stream C:
- Evaluate whether any remaining malformed-JSON salvage is needed; ensure bracket-aware parsing is sufficient and add reprompt/default if planning_block/session_header missing after JSON-first flows.
- Implement conditional tool/schema attachment to reduce token/latency when no dice likely.
- Coordinate with code/jp2 so Gemini path remains consistent.

If you can take this, create/attach bead or update 21f/519; otherwise, ignore.
