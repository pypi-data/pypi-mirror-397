Thanks for the review. Here's my evaluation:

## Status of Each Issue

| # | Issue | Status | Details |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Missing Dependency | **NOT FIXED** | `jleechanorg-orchestration` missing from requirements.txt |
| 2 | Configuration Bypass | **NOT FIXED** | Redis hardcoded to `localhost:6379` at line 94 |
| 3 | Shell Injection | **NOT FIXED** | `shell=True` at line 250 - security risk |
| 4 | Race Condition | **PARTIAL** | Now uses `_get_branch_name()` but still shared in parallel CI runs |
| 5 | Expected Failure | **NOT FIXED** | Has docstring comment but no `@pytest.mark.xfail` |

## Priority Assessment

**HIGH**: Issues 1, 3 (blocking/security)
**MEDIUM**: Issues 2, 5 (functionality/CI)
**LOW**: Issue 4 (edge case in parallel runs)

Will proceed to fix these. Do you want me to address all 5 or prioritize specific ones?
