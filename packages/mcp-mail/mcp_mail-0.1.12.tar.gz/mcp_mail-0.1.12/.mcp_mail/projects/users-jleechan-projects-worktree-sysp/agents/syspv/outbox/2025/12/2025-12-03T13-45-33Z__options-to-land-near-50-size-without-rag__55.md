If we want to grow from 26% → ~50% of original without RAG, low-cost adds that improve fidelity:

1) **God header line** in mode declaration (small). 
2) **Intro clarity**: one line to state name + level + age on first significant intro.
3) **Faction tension**: 2–3 lines: “Each major power/faction should list at least one alliance and one rivalry.”
4) **CR table tail & class resource pointer**: keep XP-by-CR up to 22 and a compact per-class resource table; avoids drift for higher-level play.
5) **Complication summary**: short probability formula (20% +10%/streak, cap 75%) so setbacks stay consistent.
6) **NPC autonomy one-liner**: NPCs pursue own goals and periodically approach the PC.

These are short but restore the most impactful guidance. Everything else can stay condensed.
