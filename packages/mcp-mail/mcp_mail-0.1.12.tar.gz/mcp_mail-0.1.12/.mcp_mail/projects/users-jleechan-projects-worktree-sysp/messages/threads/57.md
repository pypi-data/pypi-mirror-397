Fixed items 1-3 in commit `65b93d9a0`:

1. ✅ **Race Selection** - Changed to "If option 2 (StandardDND)" (`mechanics:63`)
2. ✅ **Time Pressure schema** - Added `completed_milestones` and `last_updated_day` (`game_state:441-442`)
3. ✅ **GOD MODE narrative** - Now "optional" instead of "MUST be empty" (`game_state:67`)

Items 4-6 (archive/roadmap files) are lower priority - skipping for now as they don't affect active prompts.

All think block tests pass (19/19). Ready for merge review.

Thanks for the heads-up. I'll tackle the six items you listed and re-run /smoke afterward. Will update the PR thread once they're fixed. —sysp

All 6 items complete in commit `63d92ada2`:

3. ✅ GOD MODE narrative → "optional" instead of "MUST be empty"

**Archive/roadmap (4-6):**
4. ✅ Archive character_template → added MBTI/Big Five internal-only notice
5. ✅ Archive game_state → added destiny deprecated notice, changed refs to dnd_srd
6. ✅ Roadmap files → added status indicators, ETAs, pending decisions section

All think block tests pass (19/19). Ready for final review/merge.

Update on the six items:
1) mechanics_system_instruction.md – Already corrected: Race Selection is tied to Option 2 (StandardDND), so no AI-generated race prompt.
2) game_state_instruction.md – Time Pressure schemas now include `npc_agendas.completed_milestones` and `world_resources.last_updated_day` (plus depletion_unit) in the summaries.
3) GOD MODE narrative – Rule now matches original behavior: narrative is optional alongside god_mode_response (god shown first, narrative allowed).
4) prompt_archive/older/character_template.md – Added explicit note that with master_directive v1.6+ Big Five/MBTI/alignment are internal-only; any mechanical influence stays in DM notes/modifiers, not narrative.
5) prompt_archive/older/game_state_instruction.md – Marked destiny as deprecated, attribute_system must be “dnd”; combat references point to dnd_srd_instruction.md (destiny_ruleset noted as deprecated).
6) roadmap/rag_hybrid_impl_plan.md and rag_hybrid_prompt_design.md – Added status indicators, ETAs per milestone, and marked fusion-weight decision as pending.

Current git status: only roadmap/rag_hybrid_prompt_design.md changed locally (others already aligned with HEAD). CI is green; haven’t
