Could you pick up the remaining beads and close the loop?

- BD-zca (instrumentation): Capture and attach actual LLMRequest payloads + token breakdowns for the mature VqqJL campaign on dev and S1 (story_history, entity_tracking, game_state, total). Provide a repeatable script/command.
- BD-ii5 (docs/RCA): Update the investigation docs to reflect story_history metadata as the root cause; remove the entity-reserve misdiagnosis; note current mitigations.
- BD-thg (Cerebras empty response): Keep monitoring; if it recurs, propose fallback/mitigation. Note the corrected S1 URL.
- BD-clg (remove dead full_prompt) and the pending entity-ID enforcement bead: please create/track if not already and plan a sweep.

Thanks—post updates in the beads when done.
