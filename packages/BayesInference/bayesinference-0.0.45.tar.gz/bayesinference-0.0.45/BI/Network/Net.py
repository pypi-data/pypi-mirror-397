    It encapsulates functionalities for computing clustering coefficients, eigenvector centrality, Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, and other network metrics. 
    Additionally, it extends the array_manip class to provide methods for handling network effects, including sender-receiver effects, dyadic effects, and block models.
    This class is designed to simplify the process of working with complex network structures, allowing users to easily compute metrics and model network interactions through a consistent API.
