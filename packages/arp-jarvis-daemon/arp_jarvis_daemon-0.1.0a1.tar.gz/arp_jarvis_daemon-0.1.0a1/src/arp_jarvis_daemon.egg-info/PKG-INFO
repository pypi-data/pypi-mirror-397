# arp-jarvis-daemon

Library-first daemon core for managing local ARP runtime instances (spawn/stop/list) and routing run requests to them.

This package intentionally does **not** expose an HTTP server yet; it will be wrapped by a server module later.

## Install (editable, local)

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Dev quickstart

```bash
arp-jarvis-daemon --help
```
