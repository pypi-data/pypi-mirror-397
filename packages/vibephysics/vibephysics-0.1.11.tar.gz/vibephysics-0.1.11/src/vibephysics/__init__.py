"""
VibePhysics - Physics Simulation and Annotation Tools for Blender

A Python library for creating physics-based simulations in Blender,
with support for water dynamics, rigid body physics, robot animation,
and comprehensive annotation tools.

Usage:
    from vibephysics import foundation, annotation, setup
    
    # Or import specific modules
    from vibephysics.foundation import scene, physics, water
    from vibephysics.setup import scene, viewport  # scene also available here
    from vibephysics.annotation import AnnotationManager

Note: This package requires Blender 5.0's Python environment (bpy) for simulation.
