    JavaScript in a way that feels like you never left your Django view.
- **Unintrusive Integration** 
  - Stays out of your way and works with your existing application with no need to rewrite
    your Django views or frontend code.
- **Frontend Framework Agnostic** 
  - Designed to work with any style of frontend development with no additional JavaScript
    dependencies or bloat.
- **Naturally Pythonic** 
  - Written by Python developers, for Python developers. It adheres to pythonic syntax and philosophies
    everywhere, even in JavaScript.
- **Granular Access Control** 
  - Designed with security at top of mind, with the ability to precisely control backend data
    access.
- **Extensible & Easy**

    project.
