# User guide to SIMPLE

## Installing SIMPLE

Simple can be installed using the following command,  

```
pip install chetec-simple
```

You can update to a newer version using,

```
pip install --upgrade chetec-simple
```

**Note:** Use ``import simple`` to import the package once installed.

The SIMPLE package does not come with the database files, these have to be downloaded separately (See below).

## Databases
### CCSNe
The CCSNe database contains 18 core collapse supernovae models for six different models spanning three different masses.

The database will be uploaded to Zenodo once finalised, and a more thorough description will be added here.
