              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Chronos-2 achieves the best performance on fev-bench, GIFT-Eval and Chronos Benchmark II amongst pretrained models. Check out [this notebook](notebooks/chronos-2-quickstart.ipynb) to get started with Chronos-2.
- **14 Feb 2025**: 🚀 Chronos-Bolt is now available on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart! Check out the [tutorial notebook](notebooks/deploy-chronos-to-amazon-sagemaker.ipynb) to learn how to deploy Chronos endpoints for production use in 3 lines of code.
- **12 Dec 2024**: 📊 We released [`fev`](https://github.com/autogluon/fev), a lightweight package for benchmarking time series forecasting models based on the [Hugging Face `datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/index) library.
- **26 Nov 2024**: ⚡️ Chronos-Bolt models released [on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/collections/amazon/chronos-models-65f1791d630a8d57cb718444). Chronos-Bolt models are more accurate (5% lower error), up to 250x faster and 20x more memory efficient than the original Chronos models of the same size!
- **13 Mar 2024**: 🚀 Chronos [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07815) and inference code released.

## ✨ Introduction

This package provides an interface to the Chronos family of **pretrained time series forecasting models**. The following model types are supported.

- **Chronos-2**: Our latest model with significantly enhanced capabilities. It offers zero-shot support for univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across multiple benchmarks (including fev-bench and GIFT-Eval), with the largest improvements observed on tasks that include exogenous features. It also achieves a win rate of over 90% against Chronos-Bolt in head-to-head comparisons. To learn more about Chronos, check out the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15821).
- **Chronos-Bolt**: A patch-based variant of Chronos. It chunks the historical time series context into patches of multiple observations, which are then input into the encoder. The decoder then uses these representations to directly generate quantile forecasts across multiple future steps—a method known as direct multi-step forecasting. Chronos-Bolt models are up to 250 times faster and 20 times more memory-efficient than the original Chronos models of the same size. To learn more about Chronos-Bolt, check out this [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/fast-and-accurate-zero-shot-forecasting-with-chronos-bolt-and-autogluon/).
- **Chronos**: The original Chronos family which is based on language model architectures. A time series is transformed into a sequence of tokens via scaling and quantization, and a language model is trained on these tokens using the cross-entropy loss. Once trained, probabilistic forecasts are obtained by sampling multiple future trajectories given the historical context. To learn more about Chronos, check out the [publication](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gerNCVqqtR).

## 📈 Usage

To perform inference with Chronos, the easiest way is to install this package through `pip`:

```sh
pip install chronos-forecasting
```

> [!TIP]
> For reliable production use, we recommend using Chronos-2 models through [Amazon SageMaker JumpStart](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/jumpstart/). Check out [this tutorial](notebooks/deploy-chronos-to-amazon-sagemaker.ipynb) to learn how to deploy Chronos-2 inference endpoints to AWS with just a few lines of code.


### Forecasting

A minimal example showing how to perform forecasting using Chronos-2:

```python
import pandas as pd  # requires: pip install 'pandas[pyarrow]'
from chronos import Chronos2Pipeline

pipeline = Chronos2Pipeline.from_pretrained("amazon/chronos-2", device_map="cuda")

# Load historical target values and past values of covariates
context_df = pd.read_parquet("https://autogluon.s3.amazonaws.com/datasets/timeseries/electricity_price/train.parquet")

# (Optional) Load future values of covariates
test_df = pd.read_parquet("https://autogluon.s3.amazonaws.com/datasets/timeseries/electricity_price/test.parquet")
future_df = test_df.drop(columns="target")

# Generate predictions with covariates
pred_df = pipeline.predict_df(
    context_df,
    future_df=future_df,
    prediction_length=24,  # Number of steps to forecast
    quantile_levels=[0.1, 0.5, 0.9],  # Quantile for probabilistic forecast
    id_column="id",  # Column identifying different time series
    timestamp_column="timestamp",  # Column with datetime information
    target="target",  # Column(s) with time series values to predict
)
```

We can now visualize the forecast:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # requires: pip install matplotlib

ts_context = context_df.set_index("timestamp")["target"].tail(256)
ts_pred = pred_df.set_index("timestamp")
ts_ground_truth = test_df.set_index("timestamp")["target"]

ts_context.plot(label="historical data", color="xkcd:azure", figsize=(12, 3))
ts_ground_truth.plot(label="future data (ground truth)", color="xkcd:grass green")
ts_pred["predictions"].plot(label="forecast", color="xkcd:violet")
plt.fill_between(
    ts_pred.index,
    ts_pred["0.1"],
    ts_pred["0.9"],
    alpha=0.7,
    label="prediction interval",
    color="xkcd:light lavender",
)
plt.legend()
```
