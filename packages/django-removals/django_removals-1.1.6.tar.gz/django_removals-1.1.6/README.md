Welcome to the **django-removals** - a maintainer's best friend for finding removed features in your Django project

[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/django-removals/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ambient-innovation/django-removals) | [Full documentation](https://django-removals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

Creator & Maintainer: [Ambient Digital](https://ambient.digital/)

## Features

This package will throw [Django system checks](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/checks/)
warnings for all known removals from Django v1.0 to today.

Here's an example:

![Example system check](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ambient-innovation/django-removals/963cdef1f04b9f3f8efbe6a4a893ef4abe911e07/docs/system_check_warning.png?raw=True)

The checks will either be triggered when using the Django development server

`python manage.py runserver`

or when you call the checks manually

`python manage.py check --deploy`

It focuses on Django settings but might also add more checks in the future.

## Sources

You can read up on Django deprecations in
[the official docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/deprecation/).

## Installation

- Install the package via pip:

  `pip install django-removals`

  or via pipenv:

  `pipenv install django-removals`

- Add module to `INSTALLED_APPS` within the main django `settings.py`:

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        "django_removals",
    )
    ```

Since this package adds only Django system checks, which don't run on production, you could add it only when being in
(local) debug mode.

```python
if DEBUG_MODE:
    INSTALLED_APPS += ("django_removals",)
```

### Publish to ReadTheDocs.io

- Fetch the latest changes in GitHub mirror and push them
- Trigger new build at ReadTheDocs.io (follow instructions in admin panel at RTD) if the GitHub webhook is not yet set
  up.

### Preparation and building

This package uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management and building.

- Update documentation about new/changed functionality

- Update the `CHANGES.md`

- Increment version in main `__init__.py`

- Create pull request / merge to "main"

- This project uses uv to publish to PyPI. This will create distribution files in the `dist/` directory.

  ```bash
  uv build
  ```

### Publishing to PyPI

To publish to the production PyPI:

```bash
uv publish
```

To publish to TestPyPI first (recommended for testing):

```bash
uv publish --publish-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
```

You can then test the installation from TestPyPI:

```bash
uv pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ambient-package-update
```

### Maintenance

Please note that this package supports the [ambient-package-update](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/).
So you don't have to worry about the maintenance of this package. This updater is rendering all important
configuration and setup files. It works similar to well-known updaters like `pyupgrade` or `django-upgrade`.

To run an update, refer to the [documentation page](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/)
of the "ambient-package-update".
