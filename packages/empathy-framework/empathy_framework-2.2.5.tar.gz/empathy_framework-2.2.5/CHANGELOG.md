## [1.8.0-alpha] - 2025-11-24

### Added - Claude Memory Integration

**Core Memory System**
- **ClaudeMemoryLoader**: Complete CLAUDE.md file reader with hierarchical memory loading
  - Enterprise-level memory: `/etc/claude/CLAUDE.md` or `CLAUDE_ENTERPRISE_MEMORY` env var
  - User-level memory: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (personal preferences)
  - Project-level memory: `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` (team/project specific)
  - Loads in hierarchical order (Enterprise → User → Project) with clear precedence
  - Caching system for performance optimization
  - File size limits (1MB default) and validation

**@import Directive Support**
- Modular memory organization with `@path/to/file.md` syntax
- Circular import detection (prevents infinite loops)
- Import depth limiting (5 levels default, configurable)
- Relative path resolution from base directory
- Recursive import processing with proper error handling

**EmpathyLLM Integration**
- `ClaudeMemoryConfig`: Comprehensive configuration for memory integration
  - Enable/disable memory loading per level (enterprise/user/project)
  - Configurable depth limits and file size restrictions
  - Optional file validation
- Memory prepended to all LLM system prompts across all 5 empathy levels
- `reload_memory()` method for runtime memory updates without restart
- `_build_system_prompt()`: Combines memory with level-specific instructions
- Memory affects behavior of all interactions (Reactive → Systems levels)

**Documentation & Examples**
- **examples/claude_memory/user-CLAUDE.md**: Example user-level memory file
  - Communication preferences, coding standards, work context
  - Demonstrates personal preference storage
- **examples/claude_memory/project-CLAUDE.md**: Example project-level memory file
  - Project context, architecture patterns, security requirements
  - Empathy Framework-specific guidelines and standards
- **examples/claude_memory/example-with-imports.md**: Import directive demo
  - Shows modular memory organization patterns

**Comprehensive Testing**
- **tests/test_claude_memory.py**: 15+ test cases covering all features
  - Config defaults and customization tests
  - Hierarchical memory loading (enterprise/user/project)
  - @import directive processing and recursion
  - Circular import detection
  - Depth limit enforcement
  - File size validation
  - Cache management (clear/reload)
  - Integration with EmpathyLLM
  - Memory reloading after file changes
- All tests passing with proper fixtures and mocking

### Changed

**Core Architecture**
- **empathy_llm_toolkit/core.py**: Enhanced EmpathyLLM with memory support
  - Added `claude_memory_config` and `project_root` parameters
  - Added `_cached_memory` for performance optimization
  - All 5 empathy level handlers now use `_build_system_prompt()` for consistent memory integration
  - Memory loaded once at initialization, cached for all subsequent interactions

**Dependencies**
- Added structlog for structured logging in memory module
- No new external dependencies required (uses existing framework libs)

### Technical Details

**Memory Loading Flow**
1. Initialize `EmpathyLLM` with `claude_memory_config` and `project_root`
2. `ClaudeMemoryLoader` loads files in hierarchical order
3. Each file processed for @import directives (recursive, depth-limited)
4. Combined memory cached in `_cached_memory` attribute
5. Every LLM call prepends memory to system prompt
6. Memory affects all 5 empathy levels uniformly

**File Locations**
- Enterprise: `/etc/claude/CLAUDE.md` or env var `CLAUDE_ENTERPRISE_MEMORY`
- User: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Project: `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` (preferred) or `./CLAUDE.md` (fallback)

**Safety Features**
- Circular import detection (prevents infinite loops)
- Depth limiting (default 5 levels, prevents excessive nesting)
- File size limits (default 1MB, prevents memory issues)
- Import stack tracking for cycle detection
- Graceful degradation (returns empty string on errors if validation disabled)

### Enterprise Privacy Foundation

This release is Phase 1 of the enterprise privacy integration roadmap:
- ✅ **Phase 1 (v1.8.0-alpha)**: Claude Memory Integration - COMPLETE
- ⏳ **Phase 2 (v1.8.0-beta)**: PII scrubbing, audit logging, EnterprisePrivacyConfig
- ⏳ **Phase 3 (v1.8.0)**: VSCode privacy UI, documentation
- ⏳ **Future**: Full MemDocs integration with 3-tier privacy system

**Privacy Goals**
- Give enterprise developers control over memory scope (enterprise/user/project)
- Enable local-only memory (no cloud storage of sensitive instructions)
- Foundation for air-gapped/hybrid/full-integration deployment models
- Compliance-ready architecture (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)

### Quality Metrics
- **New Module**: empathy_llm_toolkit/claude_memory.py (483 lines)
- **Modified Core**: empathy_llm_toolkit/core.py (memory integration)
- **Tests Added**: 15+ comprehensive test cases
- **Test Coverage**: All memory features covered
- **Example Files**: 3 sample CLAUDE.md files
- **Documentation**: Inline docstrings with Google style

### Breaking Changes
None - this is an additive feature. Memory integration is opt-in via `claude_memory_config`.

### Upgrade Notes
- To use Claude memory: Pass `ClaudeMemoryConfig(enabled=True)` to `EmpathyLLM.__init__()`
- Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your project root with instructions
- See examples/claude_memory/ for sample memory files
- Memory is disabled by default (backward compatible)
