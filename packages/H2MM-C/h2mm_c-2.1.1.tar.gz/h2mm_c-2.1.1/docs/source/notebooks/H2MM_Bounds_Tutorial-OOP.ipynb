Thus transition rates close to the rate of laser alternation are likely to be artifacts, and thus we want to exclude them. For $\\mu sALEX$ experiments, we find this still is not enough.\n",

    "1. Calculate *loglikelihood* and new model\n",
    "2. Check if the **model** converged\n",
    "3. Analyze the **new model**, and correct if necessary\n",

    "    2. If values are out of bounds, apply correction, method defined by argument passed to `bounds_func`\n",
    "4. Repeat optimization (back to step 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs to `hm.h2mm_limits` are all keyword argumetns, and come in the form of `min/max_[array]` where `[array]` is `prior`, `trans` or `obs`, and specify the minimum and maximum values in the respective array.\n",
    "Specifying as a float will set the value for all states, and thus the created `hm.h2mm_limits` object can be used for models with any model, while values can be specified as arrays, where each element sets the min/max of the value at that position in the given array of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `bounds_func`\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the above outline, the bounding process needs to choose how to correct the way in which a model value that is out of bound is corrected.\n",
    "There are 3 options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `minmax` shallowest correction, sets the value to its minimum or maximum\n",
    "2. `revert` prefered method, sets the value to the value in the previous model\n",
    "3. `revert_old` a more extreme form of `revert` which goes to the model before the last in the optimization, and sets the value to that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `hm.factory_h2mm_model()` with bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "You will note in the previous example, we specified the `hm.h2mm_model` explicitly, instead of using `hm.factory_h2mm_model()`. \n",
    "This is because it is possible that the `hm.factory_h2mm_model()` could create an initial model that contains out of bounds values, which could result in odd behavior during optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a way around this, you can give the `hm.h2mm_limits` object to `hm.factory_h2mm_model()` through the keyword argument `bounds`, and the function will automatically ensure the model is with bounds:\n",
