For instance in $\\mu$sALEX experiments, the laser alternation period causes donor and acceptor excitation photons, which arrive in separate streams to alternate (and thus transition) perfectly periodically, yet that has no bearing on transitions between our system. Thus transition rates close to the rate of laser alternation are likely to be artifacts, and thus we want to exclude them. For $\\mu sALEX$ experiments, we find this still is not enough.\n",

    "2. Check if the **model** converged\n",
    "3. Analyze the **new model**, and correct if necessary\n",

    "    2. If values are out of bounds, apply correction, method defined by argument passed to `bounds_func`\n",
    "4. Repeat optimization (back to step 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs to `hm.h2mm_limits` are all keyword argumetns, and come in the form of `min/max_[array]` where `[array]` is `prior`, `trans` or `obs`, and specify the minimum and maximum values in the respective array.\n",
    "Specifying as a float will set the value for all states, and thus the created `hm.h2mm_limits` object can be used for models with any model, while values can be specified as arrays, where each element sets the min/max of the value at that position in the given array of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `bounds_func`\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the above outline, the bounding process needs to choose how to correct the way in which a model value that is out of bound is corrected.\n",
    "There are 3 options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `minmax` shallowest correction, sets the value to its minimum or maximum\n",
    "2. `revert` prefered method, sets the value to the value in the previous model\n",
    "3. `revert_old` a more extreme form of `revert` which goes to the model before the last in the optimization, and sets the value to that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `hm.factory_h2mm_model()` with bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "You will note in the previous example, we specified the `hm.h2mm_model` explicitly, instead of using `hm.factory_h2mm_model()`. \n",
    "This is because it is possible that the `hm.factory_h2mm_model()` could create an initial model that contains out of bounds values, which could result in odd behavior during optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a way around this, you can give the `hm.h2mm_limits` object to `hm.factory_h2mm_model()` through the keyword argument `bounds`, and the function will automatically ensure the model is with bounds:\n",
