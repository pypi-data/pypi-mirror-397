## Overview

Container-Tester is a small Python utility that helps you test your project on
top of many different Linux distributions without having to run and maintain
lots of Docker tests yourself. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) that
can:

- Build that Dockerfile into a image and report its size and metadata.
- Run a container from that image, execute a command inside it and capture the
  logs.
- Optionally clean up images and containers when you are done.
- Iterate over a curated list of popular Python, Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora and
  Alpine base images defined in `docker-config.toml` and perform the above steps
  for each of them.

## Installation

You can use Container-Tester in two ways:

1. Install in your project:

   ```bash
   uv add container-tester
   uv run contest --help

   # or if you don't want to install:
   uvx --from container-tester contest --help
   ```

## Using Container-tester

```bash
Usage: contest [OPTIONS] [OS_NAME]

Generate, build, and run Docker resources from a base image or config file.

+- Options -------------------------------------------------------------------+
| --json    --no-json          Show output in json format                     |
|                              (use --json to enable) [default: no-json]      |
| --pretty  --no-pretty        Show output in pretty format                   |
|                              (use --pretty to enable) [default: no-pretty]  |
| --clean   --no-clean         Clean Docker resources after run               |
|                              (use --clean to enable) [default: no-clean]    |
| --install-completion         Install completion for the current shell.      |
| --show-completion            Show completion for the current shell, to copy |
|                              it or customize the installation.              |

+- Commands ------------------------------------------------------------------+
| test-config     Generate, build, and run Docker resources from a docker     |
| test-container  Generate, build, and run Docker resources from a base image.|

```

### Example

Here is a quick example that runs a simple command across all default profiles:

```bash
uv run contest test-config
```

To test only on the Ubuntu image, you can specify its base image directly and
use a custom command:

```bash
uv run contest test-container ubuntu:latest --command "echo Hello, world!"
```

## Default profiles

By default, Container-Tester comes with a handful of profiles covering common
Python, Debian/Ubuntu and Alpine base images. Each profile defines an
`image_tag` (used as the resulting image name) and the corresponding `os_name`.
A few of them are shown below- see `src/container_tester/docker-config.toml` for
the full list:

| image_tag     | os_name                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| py312_trixie  | python:3.12-slim-trixie |
| ubuntu_latest | ubuntu:latest           |
| alpine_latest | alpine:latest           |

## Custom Docker Configuration

You can define your own `docker-config.toml` file to run custom Docker images
tailored to your needs. Use the following format to specify multiple profiles:

```toml
[py311_slim]
command = ""
os_name = "python:3.11-slim"
os_commands = []
pkg_manager = "apt"

[ubuntu_latest]
command = ""
os_name = "ubuntu:latest"
os_commands = ["apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates"]
pkg_manager = "apt"

# Add more profiles as needed...
```

### Configuration Fields

- `command`: Shell command to execute inside the containers.
- `image_tag`: A unique identifier for the Docker image profile.
- `os_name`: The name and tag of the Docker image to use.
- `os_commands`: A list of shell commands to run after container startup
  (optional).
- `pkg_manager`: The package manager used by the OS (e.g., apk, dnf, apt).

### Run with Your Custom Config

After creating your `docker-config.toml` file, launch your custom Docker setup
by running:

```bash
uv run contest test-config
```
