# memberjojo

`memberjojo` is a Python library for using [Membermojo](http://membermojo.co.uk/)
data from CSV imports.\
It provides member database, and completed payments querying.\
This is done in a local SQLite database which is encrypted, and does not alter
anything on Membermojo.\
It provides tools to load, and query membership and transaction data efficiently
without having to use SQLite directly.\
When importing CSV files existing entries are dropped before import, so you can
just import the latest download and the local database is updated.

## Installation

Installing via `pip` on macos with `sqlcipher` installed via homebrew:\
(The sqlcipher bindings are compiled by pip so the `C_INCLUDE_PATH` and
`LIBRARY_PATH` are needed for the `libsqlcipher` files to be found)

```bash
brew install sqlcipher
export C_INCLUDE_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/sqlcipher/include"
export LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/sqlcipher/lib"
pip install memberjojo
```

Installing via `pip` on ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests install libsqlcipher-dev
pip install memberjojo
```

Or clone the repo and install locally with `flit`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a16bitsysop/memberjojo.git
cd memberjojo
flit install --symlink
```

## Usage

Example loading members and using Member objects:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from membermojo import Member

# database is created if it does not exist
member_database_path = Path(Path(__file__).parent, "database", "my-members.db")
member_csv_path = Path("download", "members.csv")

members = Member(member_database_path, "My DB Password")
members.import_csv(member_csv_path)

for member in members:
    print(member.first_name, member.last_name, member.member_number)

# Get full name for a given member number
found_name = members.get_name(1)
if found_name:
    print(f"Member with id of 1 is {found_name}")
else:
    print("Member 1 does not exist")
```
