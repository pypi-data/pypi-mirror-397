pyfive : A pure Python HDF5 file reader
=======================================

pyfive is an open source library for reading HDF5 files written using
pure Python (no C extensions). The package is still in development and not all
features of HDF5 files are supported.

pyfive aims to support the same API as [`h5py`](https://github.com/h5py/h5py)
for reading files. Cases where a file uses a feature that is supported by `h5py`
but not pyfive are considered bug and should be reported in our [Issues](https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/pyfive/issues).
Writing HDF5 is not a goal of pyfive and portions of the API which apply only to writing will not be
implemented.

Dependencies
============

pyfive is tested to work with Python 3.10 to 3.13.  It may also work
with other Python versions.

The only dependencies to run the software besides Python is NumPy.

Install
=======

pyfive can be installed using pip using the command::

    pip install pyfive

conda package are also available from conda-forge which can be installed::

    conda install -c conda-forge pyfive

exercised using the commands ``pytest`` from the root directory assuming the
``pytest`` package is installed.
