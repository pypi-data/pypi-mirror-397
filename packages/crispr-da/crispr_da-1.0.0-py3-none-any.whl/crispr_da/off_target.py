off-target.py

This file contains methods for assessing a CRISPR guide RNA's off-target risk against other genomes.
This is done using ISSL which is used in Crackling
Crackling can be found here: https://github.com/bmds-lab/Crackling

    '''Runs ISSL off-target scoring for the list of guides against each provided accession.

    Arguments:
        collection (CRISPRDA.Collection): A CRISPRDA collection containing the candidate guides.
        accessions (list): A list of accessions to be scored against.
        processors (int):  The number of processors to run. Zero indicates all available.

    Returns: None, all results are stored in the CRISPRDA Collection
