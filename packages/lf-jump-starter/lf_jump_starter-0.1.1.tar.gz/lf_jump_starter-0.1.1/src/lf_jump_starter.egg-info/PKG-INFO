# JuMP-Starter

The Jupyter Managed Project Starter allows you to create an interactive jupyter questionnaire to help users
quickly get started with your package.

This project was automatically generated using the LINCC-Frameworks 
[python-project-template](https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/python-project-template).

A repository badge was added to show that this project uses the python-project-template, however it's up to
you whether or not you'd like to display it!

For more information about the project template see the 
[documentation](https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Dev Guide - Getting Started

Before installing any dependencies or writing code, it's a great idea to create a
virtual environment. LINCC-Frameworks engineers primarily use `conda` to manage virtual
environments. If you have conda installed locally, you can run the following to
create and activate a new environment.

```
>> conda create -n <env_name> python=3.11
>> conda activate <env_name>
```

Once you have created a new environment, you can install this project for local
development using the following commands:

```
>> ./.setup_dev.sh
>> conda install pandoc
```

Notes:
1. `./.setup_dev.sh` will initialize pre-commit for this local repository, so
   that a set of tests will be run prior to completing a local commit. For more
   information, see the Python Project Template documentation on 
   [pre-commit](https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/practices/precommit.html)
2. Install `pandoc` allows you to verify that automatic rendering of Jupyter notebooks
   into documentation for ReadTheDocs works as expected. For more information, see
   the Python Project Template documentation on
   [Sphinx and Python Notebooks](https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/practices/sphinx.html#python-notebooks)
