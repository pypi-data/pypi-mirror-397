	Connect to a serial device using the same constructor arguments
	as `serial.Serial`::
	
	    k = Keyhole('COM4')
	
	Send a message using the `<<` operator. If the message is not
	already raw `bytes`, it will be automatically encoded to `bytes`
	and a newline will be appended if there wasn't one already::
	
	    k << 'hello'     # sends b'hello\n'
	
	Equivalently, you call the instance with the message as the
	argument::
	
	    k('hello')       # sends b'hello\n'
	    k()              # sends b'?\n' by default
	
	Whichever syntax you use, the return value will provide information
	from the first line of any reply that occurs within the timeout
	period (decoded into a `dict`, if the line was a valid `dict`
	literal) along with timing information.
	
	If the recipient of the message is a microcontroller that has
	has been programmed using the Keyhole library for the Arduino IDE,
	and it exposes variables via a Keyhole, then these variables can
	be accessed as attributes::
	
	    print(k.foo)
	    k.foo = 123
	
	and `k()` will give you a complete record of the variables and
	their values. 
	
	To close the connection, `k<<KEOF` or `k<<None` or `k._close()`
	will all work (this will also happen automatically when `k` is
	garbage-collected).
