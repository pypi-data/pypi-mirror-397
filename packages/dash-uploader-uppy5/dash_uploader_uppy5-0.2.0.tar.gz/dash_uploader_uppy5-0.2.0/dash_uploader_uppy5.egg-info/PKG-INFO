A modern [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com) file uploader component powered by [Uppy 5](https://uppy.io/).

## Features

- **Blazing Fast**: Validated to upload **almost 1.4GB in seconds**. Uses binary streaming (XHR) to bypass legacy chunking overheads.
- **Modern UI**: Built with [Uppy 5](https://uppy.io/) `Dashboard` with a sleek, responsive interface and automatic Dark Mode.
- **Large File Support**: Handles large file uploads efficiently via Flask streaming (`Werkzeug`).
- **Customizable**: Configurable file restrictions (size, type, count) directly from Python.

## Installation
```bash
pip install dash-uploader-uppy5
```

## Usage

See [usage.py](https://github.com/Ozx-68102/dash-uploader-uppy5/blob/main/usage.py) or example below.

```python
import dash
from dash import html, Input, Output, no_update

import dash_uploader_uppy5 as du

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

# Configure the upload folder
du.configurator(app, folder='uploads')

app.layout = html.Div([
    html.H1('Dash Application'),
    du.Upload(
        id='uploader',
        max_file_size=1024,  # in Megabyte, 1GB
        allowed_file_types=['.csv'],
        theme='auto',
        upload_id='files'
    ),
    html.Div(id="output-zone")
])


# Handle the callback
@app.callback(
    Output("output-zone", "children"),
    [
        Input("uploader", "uploadedFiles"),
        Input("uploader", "failedFiles")
    ],
    prevent_initial_call=True
)
def handle_upload(uploaded_files, failed_files):
    if uploaded_files:
        last_file = uploaded_files[-1]
        server_name = last_file['response']['filename']
        return f"Uploaded: {server_name}"

    if failed_files:
        return f"Error: {failed_files[0]['error']}"

    return no_update


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Credits & Inspiration

This project is a spiritual successor to the excellent [dash-uploader](https://github.com/fohrloop/dash-uploader) (now archived).
We adopted some parts of its proven Python wrapper patterns and configuration logic but replaced the underlying 
`flow.js` / `Resumable.js` with the more modern and active [Uppy 5](https://uppy.io/).  
  
Special thanks to the original authors for all their groundwork on Dash integration.
