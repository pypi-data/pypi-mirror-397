CumulusCI helps build great applications on the Salesforce platform by
automating org setup, testing, and deployment for everyone --- from
developers and admins to testers and product managers.

**Best practices, proven at scale.** CumulusCI provides a complete
development and release process created by Salesforce.org to build and
release applications to thousands of users on the Salesforce platform.
It\'s easy to start new projects with a standard set of tasks (single
actions) and flows (sequences of tasks), or customize by adding your
own.

**Batteries included.** Out-of-the-box features help you quickly:

-   Build sophisticated orgs with automatic installation of
    dependencies.
-   Load and capture sample datasets to make your orgs feel real.
-   Apply transformations to existing metadata to tailor orgs to your
    specific requirements.
-   Run builds in continuous integration systems.
-   Create end-to-end browser tests and setup automation using [Robot
    Framework](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/robotframework.html).
-   Generate synthetic data on any scale, from a single record to a
    million, using
    [Snowfakery](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook.html#large-volume-data-synthesis-with-snowfakery).

**Build anywhere.** Automation defined using CumulusCI is portable. It
is stored in a source repository and can be run from your local command
line, from a continuous integration system, or from a customer-facing
MetaDeploy installer. CumulusCI can run automation on scratch orgs
created using the Salesforce CLI, or on persistent orgs like sandboxes,
production orgs, and Developer Edition orgs.
