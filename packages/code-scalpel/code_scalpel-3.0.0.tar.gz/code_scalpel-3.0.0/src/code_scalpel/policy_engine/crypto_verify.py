# [20250108_FEATURE] v2.5.0 Guardian - Cryptographic policy verification

This module provides cryptographic verification of policy files to prevent
agents from bypassing file permission controls.

Addresses 3rd party review feedback:
"File permissions are bypassable. Agent can `chmod +w`."

Solution: Hash verification against cryptographically signed manifest stored in:
1. Git commit history (can't be modified without visible commit)
2. Environment variable (set by CI/CD, not accessible to agent)
3. External secret store (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

Security Model: FAIL CLOSED
- Missing manifest → DENY ALL
- Invalid signature → DENY ALL
- Hash mismatch → DENY ALL
