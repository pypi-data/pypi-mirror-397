# Quarto Tech Memo

> See the companion article for more background:
> G. Close, “Turning Your Notes into PDF Technical Memos and Data Science Reports,” Data Science Collective, Oct. 2025. Available: https://medium.com/data-science-collective/turning-your-notes-into-pdf-technical-memos-or-data-science-reports-ddd150273cc6

This is a [quarto extension](https://quarto.org/) to create brief technical memos in PDF 
with the modern and ⚡fast Typst engine (built into Quarto).
The memo style provides a professional single-column PDF layout 
with ample room for sidenotes and small figures in the margin.
Inspired by [Tufte handout style](https://rstudio.github.io/tufte/).
The intended use is for brief technical memos and preprints of scientific articles.
In addition, a 2-column compact variant and a 3-column A3 poster variants are provided.
For reference, a legacy IEEE paper style is also included---using the LaTeX engine.
Finally a slide deck variant using the [Clean Slide Theme](https://typst.app/universe/package/touying-quarto-clean/) is provided. 

The following screenshot shows all variants of the same document.
**All are formatted from the same source** in a few seconds
(the IEEE style, with the legacy Latex engine, dominates the rendering time).
All generated PDF files are included in the [examples](https://github.com/gael-close/quarto-tech-memo/tree/main/examples) folder.

## Usage as Python CLI tool

Install the tool, together with all dependencies, with:

```bash
pip install quarto-tech-memo

# preferably in a isolated environment with one of:
# pipx install quarto_tech_memo
# uv tool install quarto_tech_memo
```

Then use the `quarto-tech-memo` command to convert a markdown file to a polished PDF memo:

```bash
quarto-tech-memo you-file.md (--to memo1) (--preview)
```

## Usage within the provided example

Install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install cookiecutter quarto-tech-memo
```

To render the provided example:

```bash
cookiecutter -f gh:gael-close/quarto-tech-memo; cd new-dir;
quarto-tech-memo new-tech-memo.md
```

For the variants, use one of the flags `--to memo2`, `--to memo3`, `--to slides`, `--to poster`, or `--to ieee` 

Edit `new-tech-memo.md` in your favorite editor and re-run the render command
or preview changes (one every save) live with:

```bash
quarto-tech-memo new-tech-memo.md --preview
```

## Usage in an existing quarto project

To use in an existing Quarto project as an extension, run

```bash
# Install the extension (one time only)
quarto add gael-close/quarto-tech-memo

# render with: 
quarto render your-file.md --to memo1-typst
```

## Usage inside a data science project

See this repo https://github.com/gael-close/quarto-tech-paper for usage inside a [data science project](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/).

## Details

* The memo template is based on: https://github.com/kazuyanagimoto/quarto-academic-typst.
* The margin notes are formatted by the [marginalia](https://typst.app/universe/package/marginalia/) package.
* In markdown, margin notes are should created with the `.aside` class: 
  see https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html#asides. 
  Note that this should be inline with the surrounding pargaraph (like a footnote).
* Margin notes don't make sense in 2-column style. 
They are still included inline in the main paragraph nevertheless.
* The slides template is taken from https://typst.app/universe/package/touying-quarto-clean/.
* Custom Lua filters are included for various tweaks.
* To get the ORCID icon, download the [fontawesome desktop variant](https://fontawesome.com/download).

## Development

Run a test suite with [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/). 
This will format the example memo in all variants.

```bash
invoke test (--gh) (--no-ieee)
```

The `--gh` flag uses the GitHub repo instead of a local copy of the extension.
The `--no-ieee` flag skips the legacy IEEE format which requires a LaTeX installation (install via: `quarto install tinytex`)

To extract the conversion time for a given format:

```bash
invoke conversion-time --format memo1-typst
```
### Lua filters

To run the Lua filter standalone on a test file `dev.md`:

```
cd _extensions/meme1/lua-filters
quarto pandoc dev.md -t typst --lua-filter custom.lua
```

### Run as uv tool

Install the tool from the local copy of the repo with:

```bash
z quarto-tech-memo
uv tool install . -e
```

### Upload to PyPI

Increment version number in pyproject.toml, then run:

```bash
rm -fr dist/*
uv build
uvx uv-publish

```
