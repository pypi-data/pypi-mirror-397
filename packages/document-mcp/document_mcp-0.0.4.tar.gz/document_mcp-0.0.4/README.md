## 🤖 Agent Examples and Tutorials

### Agent Architecture Overview

This project provides two distinct agent implementations for document management using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Both agents interact with the same document management tools but use different architectural approaches and execution patterns.

#### Quick Reference

| Feature | Simple Agent | ReAct Agent |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Architecture** | Single-step execution | Multi-step reasoning loop with intelligent termination |
| **Chat History** | No memory between queries | Full history maintained across steps |
| **Context Retention** | Each query is independent | Builds context from all previous steps |
| **Best For** | Simple queries, direct operations | Complex multi-step tasks |
| **Output** | Structured JSON response | Step-by-step execution log |
| **Error Handling** | Basic timeout handling | Advanced retry & circuit breaker |
| **Performance** | Fast for simple tasks | Optimized for complex workflows |
| **Complexity** | Simple, straightforward | Advanced with caching & optimization |
| **Termination Logic** | N/A (single step) | **Intelligent completion detection**: task completion, step limits, error recovery, timeout management |
| **Conversational Flow** | **Independent query processing** | **Multi-round conversation support** |
| **State Management** | **Clean isolation between queries** | **Persistent context with proper cleanup** |

### Getting Started with the Agents

Choose between three agent implementations:

- **Simple Agent**: Single-step operations, structured JSON output, fast performance
- **ReAct Agent**: Multi-step workflows, contextual reasoning, production reliability  
- **Planner Agent**: Strategic planning with execution, complex task decomposition

**Agent Selection:**
- Use Simple Agent for: direct operations, JSON output, prototyping
- Use ReAct Agent for: complex workflows, multi-step planning, production environments, reasoning transparency
- Use Planner Agent for: strategic planning, complex task decomposition, hierarchical execution

### 🚀 Prompt Optimization

The system includes an automated prompt optimizer that uses real performance benchmarks to improve agent efficiency:

```bash
# Optimize specific agent
python3 -m prompt_optimizer simple
python3 -m prompt_optimizer react
python3 -m prompt_optimizer planner

# Optimize all agents  
python3 -m prompt_optimizer all

```

**Key Features:**
- **Safe Optimization**: Conservative changes that preserve all existing functionality
- **Performance-Based**: Uses real execution metrics to evaluate improvements
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Validates changes against 352 tests (unit + integration + E2E + evaluation)
- **Automatic Backup**: Safe rollback if optimization fails or breaks functionality
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Works with Simple, ReAct, and Planner agents

### Practical Examples - Step by Step

Once you have both the MCP server and an agent running, try these structured examples:

#### Example 1: Create Your First Document
```bash
👤 User: Create a new document called 'Getting Started Guide'
🤖 Agent: ✅ Successfully created the new document named 'Getting Started Guide'.
```

#### Example 2: Add Content with Chapters
```bash
👤 User: Add a chapter named '01-introduction.md' to 'Getting Started Guide' with content '# Introduction\nWelcome to Document MCP!'
🤖 Agent: ✅ Chapter '01-introduction.md' created successfully in document 'Getting Started Guide'.
```

#### Example 3: View Your Documents
```bash
👤 User: List all my documents
🤖 Agent: ✅ Found 1 document: 'Getting Started Guide' with 1 chapter, 4 words total.
```

#### Example 4: Analyze Document Statistics
```bash
👤 User: Get statistics for 'Getting Started Guide'
🤖 Agent: ✅ Document 'Getting Started Guide' contains 1 chapter, 4 words, and 1 paragraph.
```

#### Example 5: Read Full Content with Pagination
```bash
👤 User: Read the full document 'Getting Started Guide'
🤖 Agent: ✅ Retrieved page 1 of document 'Getting Started Guide' (2,450 characters, 1 of 1 pages).
   Content: # Introduction
   Welcome to Document MCP!

# For larger documents with navigation:
👤 User: Read page 2 of document 'Large Guide' with 25KB page size
🤖 Agent: ✅ Retrieved page 2 of document 'Large Guide' (25,000 characters, 2 of 5 pages).
   Navigation: Previous page available, Next page available (page 3)

# Progressive loading pattern:
👤 User: Read all pages of 'Large Guide' progressively
🤖 Agent: ✅ Processing all 5 pages progressively... Complete! Total: 125,000 characters processed.
```

#### Advanced Examples

**Search and Replace Operations:**
```bash
👤 User: Find "Welcome" in document 'Getting Started Guide'
🤖 Agent: ✅ Found 1 paragraph containing "Welcome" in chapter '01-introduction.md'.

👤 User: Replace "Welcome" with "Hello" in document 'Getting Started Guide'
🤖 Agent: ✅ Replaced 1 occurrence across 1 chapter in document 'Getting Started Guide'.
```

**Complex Multi-Step Workflows (ReAct Agent):**
```bash
👤 User: Create a research paper structure with an abstract, introduction, methodology, and conclusion
🤖 ReAct Agent: 
   Thought: I need to create a document and then add multiple chapters for a research paper structure.
   Action: create_document with name 'Research Paper'
   Observation: Document created successfully
   Thought: Now I need to add the abstract chapter...
   Action: add_chapter with name '00-abstract.md'...
   [Continues with step-by-step execution]
```

#### Try It Now - Interactive Walkthrough

Once you have the MCP server running, you can immediately test all features:

**Quick Configuration Check:**
```bash
# Verify your setup is working
python src/agents/simple_agent/main.py --check-config
```

**Test the Complete Workflow:**
```bash
# Start with simple operations
python src/agents/simple_agent/main.py --query "Create a new document called 'Test Document'"
python src/agents/simple_agent/main.py --query "Add a chapter named '01-intro.md' with content 'Hello World!'"
python src/agents/simple_agent/main.py --query "List all my documents"
python src/agents/simple_agent/main.py --query "Read the full document 'Test Document'"

# Try complex multi-step workflows
python src/agents/react_agent/main.py --query "Create a book outline with 3 chapters"
```

**Interactive Mode for Extended Testing:**
```bash
# Simple agent for straightforward tasks
python src/agents/simple_agent/main.py --interactive

# ReAct agent for complex reasoning
python src/agents/react_agent/main.py --interactive
```

This immediate hands-on approach lets you:
- ✅ Verify your configuration works correctly
- 🚀 See real responses from both agent types
- 🧠 Experience the ReAct agent's reasoning process
- 📋 Build confidence before diving deeper

### Automatic LLM Detection

The system automatically detects which LLM to use based on your `.env` configuration:

1. **OpenAI** (Priority 1): If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, uses OpenAI models (default: `gpt-4.1-mini`)
2. **Gemini** (Priority 2): If `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set, uses Gemini models (default: `gemini-2.5-flash`)

When an agent starts, it will display which model it's using:
```
Using OpenAI model: gpt-4.1-mini
```
or
```
Using Gemini model: gemini-2.5-flash
```

### Configuration

Both agents share the same configuration system and support the same command-line interface:

```bash
# Check configuration (both agents)
python src/agents/simple_agent/main.py --check-config
python src/agents/react_agent/main.py --check-config

# Single query mode (both agents)
python src/agents/simple_agent/main.py --query "list all documents"
python src/agents/react_agent/main.py --query "create a book with multiple chapters"

# Interactive mode (both agents)
python src/agents/simple_agent/main.py --interactive
python src/agents/react_agent/main.py --interactive
```
