## v0.5.0

This minor release comes with a relatively important fix for the self-consistent Hubbard parameters workflow. The dynamical assignement of pseudopotentials wrongly assigned pseudoes to some specific species combinations (e.g., `H` with `Hg`, `C` with `Co`, `Cu`). This is now fixed and tested in this version.

Moreover, two extra exit codes are added to cover some `hp.x` failures and when Hubbard parameters diverge in the linear response calculation.

### 👌 Improvements

* 👌 Parser: add exit codes for diverging Hubbard parameters  [[f475b58](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-hubbard/commit/f475b5891a67828fd00abec29e7c7fce46634307)]

## v0.2.0

This version of the plugin comes mainly with a breaking change with the protocol parameters, to align with a recent work devising improved protocols and better naming:

> G. d. M. Nascimento, F. J. d. Santos, M. Bercx, D. Grassano, G. Pizzi, and N. Marzari, [_"Accurate and efficient protocols for high-throughput first-principles materials simulations"_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03962), (2025)

This is also to align with `aiida-quantumespresso` updates.
