**py-near** is a Async client for NEAR Blockchain with native HOT Protocol & NEAR Intents support

## Examples
<details>
  <summary>📚 Click to see some basic examples</summary>


**Few steps before getting started...**
- Install the latest stable version of py-near, simply running `pip install py-near`
- Create NEAR account and get your private key [wallet](https://wallet.near.org/create)

### Simple money transfer

```python
from py_near.account import Account
import asyncio
from py_near.dapps.core import NEAR

ACCOUNT_ID = "bob.near"
PRIVATE_KEY = "ed25519:..."


async def main():
   acc = Account(ACCOUNT_ID, PRIVATE_KEY)

   await acc.startup()
   print(await acc.get_balance() / NEAR)
   print(await acc.get_balance("bob.near") / NEAR)

   tr = await acc.send_money("bob.near", NEAR * 2)
   print(tr.transaction.hash)
   print(tr.logs)


asyncio.run(main())
```

### Working with NEAR Intents (OmniBalance)

```python
from py_near.omni_balance import OmniBalance
import asyncio

ACCOUNT_ID = "bob.near"
PRIVATE_KEY = "ed25519:..."


async def main():
   omni = OmniBalance(ACCOUNT_ID, PRIVATE_KEY)
   await omni.startup()

   # Create intent with multiple actions: transfer, token swap, and auth call
   commitment = omni.transfer(
      tokens={"nep141:wrap.near": "5"},
      receiver_id="alice.near",
      memo="Test transfer",
   )._token_diff({
      "nep141:wrap.near": "-5",
   }).auth_call("contract.near", msg="test").sign()

   # Simulate intent before submitting
   sim = await omni.simulate_intent(commitment)
   print(sim.logged_intents)

   # Submit intent to solver network
   intent_hash = await omni.publish_intents(commitment)
   print(f"Intent hash: {intent_hash}")

   # Wait for transaction hash
   tr_hash = await omni.get_tr_hash_from_intent(intent_hash)
   print(f"Transaction hash: {tr_hash}")

   await omni.shutdown()


asyncio.run(main())
```

### Parallel requests

Only one parallel request can be made from one private key.
All transaction calls execute sequentially.
To make several parallel calls you need to use several private keys



```python3
acc = Account("bob.near", private_key1)

for i in range(2):
  signer = InMemorySigner.from_random(AccountId("bob.near"), KeyType.ED25519)
  await acc.add_full_access_public_key(str(signer.public_key))
  print(signer.secret_key)
```

Now we can call transactions in parallel

```python3
acc = Account("bob.near", [private_key1, private_key2, private_key3])
# request time = count transactions / count public keys
tasks = [
  asyncio.create_task(acc.send_money("alisa.near", 1)),
  asyncio.create_task(acc.send_money("alisa.near", 1)),
  asyncio.create_task(acc.send_money("alisa.near", 1)),
]
for t in tasks:
  await t
```
