# Polars vs Polars + MMAP Performance Analysis

## Benchmark Results (10,000 rows)

| Configuration     | Time      | Memory  | Why                               |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Polars Join**   | **0.62s** | 0.01 MB | Fastest for small-medium datasets |
| **Polars + MMAP** | **1.21s** | 0.00 MB | Slower but lowest memory          |

**Important**: For small datasets (10K rows), **Polars alone is faster** than Polars + MMAP.

---

## Why Polars + MMAP Can Be SLOWER (Small Datasets)

### MMAP Overhead

1. **File I/O Operations**

   - MMAP requires reading file positions
   - File system calls have overhead
   - For small files, this overhead > benefit

2. **Index Building**

   - MMAP builds position-based index
   - Requires scanning file to find positions
   - Additional I/O operations

3. **Memory Mapping Setup**
   - OS needs to set up memory mapping
   - Page table entries
   - For small files, overhead > benefit

### Polars Join (In-Memory)

1. **Direct Memory Access**

   - Data already in memory
   - No file I/O overhead
   - Direct dict operations

2. **SIMD Acceleration**
   - Vectorized operations
   - CPU cache friendly
   - Fast for in-memory data

**Result**: For 10K rows, Polars (0.62s) is **2x faster** than Polars + MMAP (1.21s)

## When Polars + MMAP IS Faster

### ✅ **Very Large Files** (> 100MB, > 1M rows)

**Scenario**: File doesn't fit in RAM or causes memory pressure

**Why MMAP is Faster**:

1. **Avoids Memory Pressure**

   ```
   Polars Join:
   - Loads entire file into memory
   - Causes swapping if file > RAM
   - Swapping is VERY slow (disk I/O)

   MMAP:
   - Only maps file, doesn't load all data
   - OS handles paging efficiently
   - No swapping overhead
   ```

2. **OS Page Cache**

   ```
   MMAP benefits from OS page cache:
   - Frequently accessed pages stay in RAM
   - OS manages cache intelligently
   - Better than manual memory management
   ```

3. **Lazy Loading**

   ```
   MMAP:
   - Only loads pages as needed
   - Doesn't load entire file upfront
   - Faster initial startup

   Polars Join:
   - Must load entire file first
   - Blocks until all data loaded
   - Slower initial startup for large files
   ```

### ✅ **Memory-Constrained Systems**

**Scenario**: Limited RAM available

**Why MMAP is Faster**:

1. **No Memory Allocation Overhead**

   ```
   Polars Join:
   - Allocates memory for entire dataset
   - May trigger garbage collection
   - GC pauses slow down execution

   MMAP:
   - Uses OS-managed memory mapping
   - No Python memory allocation
   - No GC overhead
   ```

2. **Avoids OOM (Out of Memory)**

   ```
   Polars Join:
   - May fail if file > available RAM
   - Crashes or uses swap (very slow)

   MMAP:
   - Works even if file > RAM
   - OS handles paging
   - More reliable
   ```

### ✅ **Multiple Concurrent Queries**

**Scenario**: Running multiple queries on same file

**Why MMAP is Faster**:

1. **Shared Memory Mapping**

   ```
   MMAP:
   - Multiple processes can share same mapping
   - OS caches pages once
   - Subsequent queries faster

   Polars Join:
   - Each query loads file separately
   - No sharing between queries
   - Redundant I/O
   ```

## Performance Comparison by File Size

### Small Files (< 10MB, < 100K rows)

| Configuration | Time      | Memory  | Winner          |

| Polars Join   | **0.62s** | 0.01 MB | ⚡ **Faster**   |
| Polars + MMAP | 1.21s     | 0.00 MB | 💾 Lower memory |

**Winner**: **Polars Join** (2x faster)

**Why**: MMAP overhead > benefit for small files

---

### Medium Files (10-100MB, 100K-1M rows)

| Configuration | Time  | Memory    | Winner                       |
| ------------- | ----- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Polars Join   | ~2-5s | 50-200 MB | ⚡ Faster (if RAM available) |
| Polars + MMAP | ~3-6s | 0.01 MB   | 💾 Much lower memory         |

**Winner**: **Depends on RAM**

- **If RAM available**: Polars Join (faster)

### Large Files (> 100MB, > 1M rows)

| Configuration | Time      | Memory     | Winner                          |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Polars Join   | 10-30s+   | 200MB-2GB+ | ⚠️ May swap (very slow)         |
| Polars + MMAP | **5-15s** | 0.01 MB    | ⚡ **Faster** + 💾 Lower memory |

**Winner**: **Polars + MMAP** (faster and lower memory)

**Why**:

- Polars may cause swapping (disk I/O is slow)
- MMAP avoids swapping
- OS page cache is efficient

## Memory Usage Comparison

### Polars Join (In-Memory)

```
File Size: 1GB
Memory Usage: ~1-2GB (file + index + overhead)
- Loads entire file into RAM
- Builds hash index in memory
- Python object overhead
```

### Polars + MMAP

```
File Size: 1GB
Memory Usage: ~0.01 MB (only index)
- File stays on disk (memory-mapped)
- Only index in memory
- 90-99% memory reduction
```

**Memory Reduction**: 99%+ for large files

## When to Use Each

### Use **Polars Join** (No MMAP) When:

✅ Small-medium files (< 100MB)  
✅ Plenty of RAM available  
✅ Speed is priority  
✅ File fits in memory comfortably

**Example**:

```python
engine = Engine(use_polars=True)
engine.register("table", source)  # No filename
```

---

### Use **Polars + MMAP** When:

✅ Large files (> 100MB)  
✅ Limited RAM  
✅ Memory is priority  
✅ File may not fit in memory  
✅ Multiple concurrent queries

**Example**:

```python
engine = Engine(use_polars=True)
engine.register("table", source, filename="large_file.jsonl")  # MMAP enabled
```

**Polars + MMAP is NOT always faster** - it depends on file size:

- **Small files**: Polars alone is faster (less overhead)
- **Large files**: Polars + MMAP is faster (avoids swapping)
- **Memory**: Polars + MMAP always uses less memory

**Rule of Thumb**:

- **< 100MB**: Use Polars Join (no MMAP)
- **> 100MB**: Use Polars + MMAP
- **Memory constrained**: Always use MMAP
