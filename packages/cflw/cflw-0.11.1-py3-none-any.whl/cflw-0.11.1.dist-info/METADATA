## cflw

A library for synchronously running nodes in a state graph.

Advantages: (envisaged)

* lean implementation
* customization towards production possible
* multi-developer scenario kept in mind

Code sketch:

    graph = Graph()
    graph.add_node(AllNodes.node1)
    graph.add_node(AllNodes.node2)
    graph.add_edge(AllNodes.node1, AllNodes.node2)
    state = CfState()
    ctx = CfCtx()
    rr = GraphRunner().run(graph, state, ctx, entry_point=AllNodes.node1)
