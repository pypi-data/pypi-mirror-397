## Reminders
- [x] 2025-12-15 | done | Create an Amplitude skill for vibeship-spawner - helps with filtering events, viewing properties, creating charts in Amplitude dashboard
- [x] 2025-12-15 | done | Work on Obsidian connections - how Mind integrates with Obsidian, document it, share on site and README. Wikilinks, graph view compatibility, vault setup.
- [x] 2025-12-15 | done | Check vibeship-spawner for agent spawning MCP tools - need to find/confirm the spawning capability so we can integrate mind_spawn_helper with Spawner. Design the funnel: Mind detects stuck -> packages problem -> hands off to Spawner's agent spawning tools.
- [x] 2025-12-15 | done | Research memory architectures: how best memory layers (mem0, Zep, LangMem) structure session vs long-term memory, what they're optimizing for, and how to improve Mind's session/memory interaction
- [x] 2025-12-16 | done | Deep dive on SELF_IMPROVE.md - current version is too shallow (just preferences/blind spots). Need to think about: learning style, communication patterns, decision patterns, collaboration style, what actually worked. Make it real self-improvement, not just a personality quiz.

- [ ] 2025-12-18 | absolute | Add Docker as alternative installation path for Mind - for users who prefer containerized tools or have Python environment issues. Need to handle volume mounts for .mind/ folders and workspace path resolution.
- [x] 2025-12-14 | done | Phase 9 (Learning Style) is the AGI step - model HOW user learns, not just WHAT. New pattern type LEARNING_STYLE with categories like [concepts], [debugging], [decisions], [communication]
- [x] 2025-12-14 | done | After Phases 6-7, build Phase 8 (Contradiction Detection) - uses Jaccard similarity for keyword overlap, detects opposing words like prefer/avoid, verbose/terse
- [x] 2025-12-14 | done | Build Phase 6 (Confidence Decay) + Phase 7 (Reinforcement) together - they work as a pair. Start with calculate_decayed_confidence() and PatternMetadata storage in pattern_metadata.json
- [ ] 2026-01-12 | absolute | Review all docs for accuracy - check version banners match implementation, update last-updated dates. Docs: README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, HOW_IT_WORKS.md, MCP_TOOLS.md
- [ ] a/b test | context | A/B test whether explicit mind_recall() instruction in CLAUDE.md is needed when SessionStart hook already calls it. Test: remove instruction, see if context still loads correctly.
- [x] 2025-12-13 | done | Check if reminder marking works - mark_reminder_done() exists but isn't exposed via MCP tool. Either add mind_reminder_done tool or auto-mark on recall.
- [ ] self-improvement | context | Design SELF_IMPROVE.md once session system is validated - meta-learning layer for patterns, blind spots, what works
- [x] 2025-12-13 | done | Improve reminders with context-matching (Phase B) - add keyword triggers like 'remind me when we work on auth'
- [x] 2025-12-13 | done | Improve reminders with context-matching
