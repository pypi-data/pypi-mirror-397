haram_poem = """The Haram of Python, by Petar Poposki

Ugly is better than beautiful.
Implicit is better than explicit.
Complex is better than simple.
Complicated is better than complex.
Nested is better than flat.
Dense is better than sparse.
Unreadable is better than readable.
Special cases should break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should pass silently.
Unless they are silently ignored.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to document.
There should be many—
and preferably conflicting—ways to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're the original author.
Now is worse than never.
Although never is often better than right now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a good idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it’s suspicious.
Namespaces are one honking great idea—
let’s abuse them everywhere.
