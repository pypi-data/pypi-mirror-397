# NDTkit Python API

This Python API provides a high-level interface to interact with the [NDTkit](https://www.testia.com/product/ndtkit-ut/) desktop application. It allows developers to script and automate NDTkit features remotely, leveraging the full power of the underlying Java application through a simple and pythonic library.

## ⚙️ How it Works

The API acts as a client that communicates with a dedicated socket server running within the NDTkit Java application or that uses directly py4j for basic Java API call.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before using this API, you must have:

1.  **Python 3.9+** installed.
2.  The **NDTkit 4.1+** installed.
3.  The Java socket server for the API must be running. The Python API can automatically launch it if configured correctly.

## ⬇️ Installation & Configuration

1.  **Install the library**

```
pip install ndtkit-api
```

2.  **Configure the connection**: NDTkit and this API are sey with a socket server and a Py4j server that runs on the same IP:PORT, so no change are needed only if this information needs to be expressly changed. If the NDTkit software needs to be launched from an external Python code that embeds this library, it's possible to set the `NDTKIT_FILEPATH` and this API will launch the software automatically if no socket server is detected. Here is an example on how to configure these different variables:

    ```python
    from ndtkit_api.config import config

    config.NDTKIT_FILEPATH = "C:/Users/admin/NDTkit/NDTkit.vbs"
    config.SERVER_HOST = "127.0.0.1"          # default value
    config.SERVER_PORT = 32146              # default value
    config.SERVER_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT = 120  # default value
    ```

    - **`NDTKIT_FILEPATH`**: **This is the most critical setting.** It's the command used to launch the Java socket server. The Python API will execute this command if it cannot connect to the server.
    - **`SERVER_HOST`**: The IP address of the machine running NDTkit. Use `127.0.0.1` if it's on the same machine.
    - **`SERVER_PORT`**: The port for the socket communication. This must match the port the NDTkit server is listening on.
    - **`SERVER_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`**: After this timing (in seconds) this API will stop attempting to connect to NDTkit's socket server

## 📝 Usage Example

Here is a simple example showing how to open a C-Scan, modify a pixel, and save it to a new file.

```python
# examples.py

from ndtkit_api import NDTKitCScanInterface, ndtkit_socket_connection
from ndtkit_api.model.frame.NICartographyFrameCScan import NICartographyFrameCScan


def change_pixel_value(input_file: str, output_file: str):
    """
    Opens a C-Scan, modifies the value of the first pixel, saves it,
    and re-opens it for display.
    """
    print(f"Opening C-Scan: {input_file}")
    # The server is launched automatically if not running
    cscan: NICartographyFrameCScan = NDTKitCScanInterface.open_cscan(input_file)

    if not cscan:
        print("Failed to open C-Scan.")
        return

    print(f"C-Scan opened successfully with UUID: {cscan.get_uuid()}")

    print("Retrieving data matrix...")
    data: list[list[float]] = cscan.get_data()
    print(f"Original value at [0][0]: {data[0][0]}")

    # Modify the data
    data[0][0] = 12.0
    print(f"Setting new value at [0][0] to 12.0")
    cscan.set_data(data)

    print(f"Saving modified C-Scan to: {output_file}")
    NDTKitCScanInterface.save_cscan(cscan, output_file)

    print("Re-opening the saved C-Scan to verify.")
    NDTKitCScanInterface.open_cscan(output_file, displayResult=True)
    print("Done.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    ndtkit_socket_connection.launch_ndtkit() # Launch NDTkit if it is not already done
    # Make sure to use paths that are valid on your system
    input_cscan_path = "C:/Users/admin/Documents/Data/dd_carto.nkc"
    output_cscan_path = "C:/Users/admin/Documents/Data/result.nkc"
    change_pixel_value(input_cscan_path, output_cscan_path)

```

You can find **practical usage examples** for this API on the [dedicated Github page](https://github.com/cedric-bertrand-testia/ndtkit-python-api-examples).

## ✨ A class/method is available in the Java API but it is not appearing in this Python API

It can be reachable anyway, it's just the auto-completion of your IDE that is not working. Actually this Python API is using [py4j](https://www.py4j.org/) that allows to access any Java API function.
Here's an example on how to access to `agi.ndtkit.api.NDTKitCScanInterface.openCScan(String)` without using directly the API:

```python
from ndtkit_api.ndtkit_socket_connection import gateway

gateway.jvm.agi.ndtkit.api.NDTKitCScanInterface.openCScan("path/to/my/cscan") # type: ignore
```

So please refer to the NDTkit Javadoc to have an exhaustive look at all the available actions and call them using this solution if they are not available directly in this Python API.

## 🚀 Deploying Your Plugin

This library includes a command-line tool to help you build your plugin and deploy it to the correct folder on your PC. To use it, follow these instructions:

1.  Open your terminal (e.g., PowerShell or CMD).
2.  Navigate (`cd`) to the root directory of your plugin project (the folder that contains your `main.py` or main entry script).
3.  Activate your Python virtual environment if ndtkit-api has been installed there.
4.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    deploy
    ```

### First Run: Configuration

The **first time** you run `deploy` in your project, a configuration wizard will ask you four questions:

1.  **Plugin Name:** The name for your final `.exe` file (defaults to your current folder's name).
2.  **Main .py entry file:** The main script to compile (defaults to `./main.py`).
3.  **Target Software:** The NDTkit software you are targeting (e.g., UT, RT, ET).
4.  **Software Version:** The NDTkit version (e.g., `4.1`).

This process creates a `build_config.json` file in your project directory.

### What Happens Next

After configuring, the `deploy` command will automatically:

1.  Run **PyInstaller** to package your script and all its dependencies into a single `.exe` file. This file will be placed in a new `dist/` folder.
2.  **Copy** the final `.exe` from the `dist/` folder to the correct NDTkit plugins directory on your computer (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourUser>\.ndtkit\Conf_4.1_RT\plugins\`).

Your plugin is now installed and ready to be used in the NDTkit application.

> **Note:** On subsequent runs, the script will reuse the settings from `build_config.json`. If you need to change your configuration (e.g., to target a new version), you can simply delete this file and run `deploy` again to be re-prompted.
