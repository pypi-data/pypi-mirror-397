  # ==============================================================================
  # PURE PYTHON WHEEL BUILD (ACTIVE)
  # ==============================================================================
  # This builds a single universal wheel that works on all platforms.
  # Use this configuration when your package contains only Python code.
  #
  # If you add compiled extensions (C/C++/Cython/Rust), you need platform-specific
  # wheels instead. To switch:
  # 1. Comment out the "build-wheel" job below
  # 2. Uncomment the "build-wheels" job at the bottom of this section
  # 3. Update the "publish-to-pypi" job to depend on "build-wheels" instead of "build-wheel"
  # ==============================================================================
