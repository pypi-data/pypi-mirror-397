## ⚙️ Configuration

After first launch, a config.json file will be created automatically (usually in your platform’s app data directory).

Example:
```json
{
    "output_format": "flac",
    "output_directory": "/your/music/directory",
    "use_metadata_tagging": true,
    "stream_quality": "25",
    "stream_player": "mpv",
    "test_mode": false,
    "delete_raw_files": true,
    "keep_cover_file": false,

    "base_url": "https://dabmusic.xyz/api",
    "debug": false,
    "show_progress": true,
    "config_version": 1
}
```
**NOTE**: You can set-up configs interactively using `dabcli config` or find the config.json file location using `dabcli config --path`.
