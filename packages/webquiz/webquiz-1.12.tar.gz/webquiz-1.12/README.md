## 📋 Configuration Format

### Quiz Files

Questions are stored in YAML files in the `quizzes/` directory. The server automatically creates a `default.yaml` file if the directory is empty.

**Example quiz file** (`quizzes/math_quiz.yaml`):

```yaml
title: "Mathematics Quiz"
randomize_questions: true  # Set to true to randomize question order for each student (default: false)
questions:
  - question: "What is 2 + 2?"
    options:
      - "3"
      - "4"
      - "5"
      - "6"
    correct_answer: 1  # 0-indexed (option "4")

  - question: "What is 5 × 3?"
    options:
      - "10"
      - "15"
      - "20"
      - "25"
    correct_answer: 1  # 0-indexed (option "15")
```

**Question Randomization:**
- Set `randomize_questions: true` in your quiz YAML to give each student a unique question order
- Each student receives a randomized order that persists across sessions
- Helps prevent cheating and ensures fair testing
- Default is `false` (questions appear in YAML order)

**Question Grouping (stick_to_the_previous):**
- Use `stick_to_the_previous: true` on questions that should stay adjacent to their predecessor during randomization
- Useful for reading passages followed by related questions
- Groups are shuffled as units while preserving internal order
- Example: Q1→Q2(sticky)→Q3(sticky) always appear together as [Q1,Q2,Q3]
- First question cannot have this flag (no previous question)
- Admin panel shows 🔗 indicator on grouped questions

**Question Points:**
- Each question can have a custom point value using the `points` field (default: 1)
- Points are tracked and displayed in:
  - Live stats: shows earned points / total points for each user
  - Final results: displays points earned along with correct/incorrect count
  - Users CSV: includes `earned_points` and `total_points` columns
- Questions with more than 1 point show a trophy indicator (🏆) during the quiz

Example:
```yaml
questions:
  - question: "Easy question"
    options: ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
    correct_answer: 0
    # points: 1  (default, can be omitted)

  - question: "Hard question worth 3 points"
    options: ["X", "Y", "Z"]
    correct_answer: 2
    points: 3  # This question is worth 3 points
```

**Text Input Questions:**

In addition to multiple choice questions, you can create text input questions where students type their answer. Questions with `checker` field are automatically detected as text input questions:

```yaml
questions:
  - question: "What is 2+2?"
    default_value: ""           # Initial value shown in textarea
    correct_value: "4"          # Shown when answer is wrong (if show_right_answer is true)
    checker: |                  # Python code to validate the answer
      assert user_answer.strip() == '4', 'Expected 4'
    points: 1

  - question: "Calculate sqrt(16)"
    correct_value: "4.0"
    checker: |
      result = float(user_answer)
      assert abs(result - sqrt(16)) < 0.01, f'Expected 4, got {result}'
    points: 2
```

**Text Question Fields:**
- `question` - Question text (required)
- `checker` - Required to identify as text question (can be empty for exact match)
- `default_value` - Initial value shown in textarea (optional)
- `correct_value` - Correct answer shown when student is wrong (optional)
- `points` - Points for correct answer (default: 1)

**Checker Code:**
- Uses variable `user_answer` (the student's text input)
- Available: `math` module (use `math.sqrt`, `math.sin`, etc.)
- Available helper functions:
  - `to_int(str)` - Convert string to integer (strips whitespace)
  - `distance(str)` - Parse distance with units: "2000", "2000m", "2км", "2km" all return 2000
  - `direction_angle(str)` - Parse direction angle: "20" returns 2000, "20-30" returns 2030
- If checker raises any exception, the answer is marked incorrect
- If no checker is provided, exact match with `correct_value` is used (with whitespace stripped)

**Checker Templates:**

You can configure reusable checker templates in your `webquiz.yaml`:

```yaml
checker_templates:
  - name: "Exact Match"
    code: "assert user_answer.strip() == 'expected', 'Wrong answer'"
  - name: "Numeric Check"
    code: "assert float(user_answer) == 42, 'Expected 42'"
  - name: "Contains Check"
    code: "assert 'keyword' in user_answer.lower(), 'Must contain keyword'"
```

Templates appear in the admin quiz editor for easy insertion.

### Server Configuration

Optional server configuration file (`webquiz.yaml`):

```yaml
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8080
  include_ipv6: false  # Include IPv6 addresses in network interfaces list
  url_format: "http://{IP}:{PORT}/"  # URL format for admin panel (use {IP} and {PORT} placeholders)

registration:
  approve: false  # Set to true to require admin approval
  fields:
    - name: "full_name"
      label: "Full Name"
      required: true

quiz:
  show_right_answer: false          # Show correct answer after submission
  show_answers_on_completion: true  # Reveal answers only after all students complete
```

All configuration sections are optional and have sensible defaults.

### Answer Visibility Options

WebQuiz offers flexible control over when students can see correct answers:

- **`show_right_answer: true`** (default): Students see correct answers immediately after submitting each question
- **`show_right_answer: false`**: Correct answers are completely hidden during the quiz and on the final results page
- **`show_answers_on_completion: true`**: Works with `show_right_answer: false` to reveal answers dynamically:
  - Answers remain hidden until ALL students complete the quiz
  - Students see a waiting message with a reload button
  - Once all students finish, correct answers become visible
  - If new students register, answers are hidden again until everyone completes
  - In approval mode, only approved students count toward completion

**Example Use Case**: Useful for collaborative learning environments where you want students to discuss answers together after everyone has completed the quiz independently.

### SSH Tunnel for Public Access

WebQuiz can expose your local server to the internet via an SSH reverse tunnel, making it accessible from a public URL. This is useful for:
- Running quizzes from a local computer without port forwarding
- Temporary public access without dedicated hosting
- Classroom environments where students connect from outside the network

**Configuration** (`webquiz.yaml`):

**Option 1: Fetch config from server**
```yaml
tunnel:
  server: "tunnel.example.com"          # SSH tunnel server hostname
  public_key: "keys/id_ed25519.pub"     # Path to SSH public key (auto-generated if missing)
  private_key: "keys/id_ed25519"        # Path to SSH private key (auto-generated if missing)
  # Config will be fetched from https://tunnel.example.com/tunnel_config.yaml
```

**Option 2: Local config (bypasses server fetch)**
```yaml
tunnel:
  server: "tunnel.example.com"
  public_key: "keys/id_ed25519.pub"
  private_key: "keys/id_ed25519"
  socket_name: "my-quiz-socket"      # Optional: Fixed socket name (default: random 6-8 chars)
  config:  # Optional: Provide locally to skip fetching from server
    username: "tunneluser"
    socket_directory: "/var/run/tunnels"
    base_url: "https://tunnel.example.com/tests"
```

**How it works:**

1. **Automatic Key Generation**: If keys don't exist, WebQuiz automatically generates ED25519 SSH key pairs
2. **Admin Control**: Navigate to the admin panel to see the tunnel status
3. **Copy Public Key**: Copy the generated public key and add it to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on your tunnel server
4. **Connect**: Click the "Connect" button in the admin panel to establish the tunnel
5. **Public URL**: Once connected, a public URL will be displayed (e.g., `https://tunnel.example.com/tests/a3f7b2/`)
6. **Auto-Reconnect**: If the connection drops, WebQuiz automatically attempts to reconnect

**Server Requirements:**
- The tunnel server must be configured to support Unix domain socket forwarding
- The server should provide a `tunnel_config.yaml` endpoint at `https://[server]/tunnel_config.yaml` with:
  ```yaml
  username: tunneluser
  socket_directory: /var/run/tunnels
  base_url: https://tunnel.example.com/tests
  ```

**Security Notes:**
- SSH keys are generated with no passphrase for automated connection
- Keys are stored with proper permissions (600 for private key)
- Connection is admin-initiated (no auto-connect on startup)
- Connection status is shown in real-time via WebSocket

## 📊 Data Export

User responses are automatically exported to CSV files with quiz-prefixed filenames and unique suffixes to prevent overwrites:

**Example:** `math_quiz_user_responses_0001.csv`

```csv
user_id,question,selected_answer,correct_answer,is_correct,time_taken_seconds
123456,"What is 2 + 2?","4","4",True,3.45
123456,"What is 5 × 3?","15","15",True,2.87
```

A second file with `.users.csv` suffix contains user statistics:

```csv
user_id,username,registered_at,total_questions_asked,correct_answers,earned_points,total_points,total_time
123456,student1,2025-01-15T10:30:00,5,4,7,9,12:46
```

- `total_time` - Total quiz completion time in `MM:SS` format (minutes:seconds)
- `earned_points` - Points earned from correct answers
- `total_points` - Maximum possible points for questions answered

CSV files are created with proper escaping and include all user response data. Files are flushed periodically (every 5 seconds) to ensure data persistence.

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding Your Own Quizzes

1. **Create a YAML file** in the `quizzes/` directory
   ```bash
   # Example: quizzes/science_quiz.yaml
   ```

2. **Add your questions** following the format:
   ```yaml
   title: "Science Quiz"
   questions:
     - question: "What is H2O?"
       options: ["Water", "Hydrogen", "Oxygen", "Salt"]
       correct_answer: 0
   ```

3. **Switch to your quiz** via the admin interface
   - Access `/admin` with your master key
   - Select your quiz from the dropdown
   - Click "Switch Quiz"

### Admin Interface

Enable admin features with a master key:

```bash
webquiz --master-key secret123
```

Access admin panels:
- `/admin` - Quiz management and user approval
- `/files` - View logs, CSV files, and edit configuration
- `/live-stats` - Real-time user progress dashboard

The admin panel automatically detects when the package has been updated while the server is running and displays a "Restart Required" notification, prompting you to restart the server to use the new version.

### Styling

- Templates are located in `webquiz/templates/`
- Built-in dark/light theme toggle
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Generated `static/index.html` can be customized (regenerates on quiz switch)

## 🛠️ Development

### Building Binary Executable

Create a standalone executable with PyInstaller:

```bash
# Build binary
poetry run build_binary

# Or directly
python -m webquiz.build

# The binary will be created at:
./dist/webquiz

# Run the binary
./dist/webquiz
./dist/webquiz --master-key secret123
```

The binary includes all templates and configuration examples, with automatic directory creation on first run.

### Key Technical Decisions

- **Multi-quiz system**: Questions loaded from `quizzes/` directory with YAML files
- **Master key authentication**: Admin endpoints protected with decorator-based authentication
- **Server-side timing**: All timing calculated server-side for accuracy
- **Server-side question randomization**: Random question order generated server-side, stored per-user, ensures unique randomized order for each student with session persistence
- **Middleware error handling**: Clean error management with proper HTTP status codes
- **CSV module usage**: Proper escaping for data with commas/quotes
- **Smart file naming**: CSV files prefixed with quiz names, unique suffixes prevent overwrites
- **Dynamic quiz switching**: Complete server state reset when switching quizzes
- **WebSocket support**: Real-time updates for admin and live statistics
- **Binary distribution**: PyInstaller for standalone executable with auto-configuration

### Architecture

- **Backend**: Python 3.9-3.14 with aiohttp async web framework
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Storage**: In-memory with periodic CSV backups (30-second intervals)
- **Session Management**: Cookie-based with server-side validation
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket for live stats and admin notifications

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Kill process using port 8080
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
```

**Virtual environment issues:**
```bash
# Recreate virtual environment
rm -rf venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Quiz not loading:**
- Check that quiz YAML files have valid syntax
- Verify `quizzes/` directory exists and contains `.yaml` files
- Check server logs for errors
- Restart server after adding new quiz files

**Admin interface not accessible:**
- Ensure you started server with `--master-key` option
- Or set `WEBQUIZ_MASTER_KEY` environment variable
- Check that you're using the correct master key

**Tests failing:**
- Always run tests in virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install test dependencies: `poetry install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Use parallel testing: `pytest tests/ -v -n 4`

**Daemon not stopping:**
```bash
# Check status
webquiz --status

# Force kill if needed
cat webquiz.pid | xargs kill -9
rm webquiz.pid
```
