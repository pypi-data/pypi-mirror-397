# namel3ss
Build AI-native applications in plain English.

namel3ss (pronounced nameless) is an English-first, AI-native programming language, built from the ground up to support AI. Everything your app needs — **data, UI, backend logic, and AI** — lives together in one `.ai` file. You describe what your system is and what it should do. namel3ss makes it executable.

---

## Why namel3ss
Modern application development is fragmented.

One stack for the backend.  
Another for the UI.  
A separate pile for prompts, agents, memory, tool calling, orchestration, tracing.

namel3ss removes the glue. It keeps the program **readable**, the runtime **deterministic**, and AI **explicit and inspectable**.

---

## What makes it different
- **One file** can define data models, UI pages, flows, and AI behavior.
- **Deterministic by design**. AI is the only non-deterministic boundary — and it’s explicit.
- **Inspectable AI**: memory, tools, and traces are visible.
- **A real toolchain**: CLI, formatter, linter, Studio.
- **If it’s hard to understand, it’s wrong.**

---

## 10-second demo
```bash
pip install namel3ss
n3 new crud
n3 crud/app.ai studio
```
You just generated a working app and opened Studio to run it, inspect state, and see traces.

---

## The Rule of 3
The “3” in namel3ss is not decoration. It’s a promise.

If you cannot understand the basics of namel3ss in 3 minutes, we consider that a design failure — and we will redesign it.

---

## What you can build today
CRUD dashboards (records → forms/tables → validation). Internal tools and admin panels. AI assistants over your records (with memory and traces). Multi-agent workflows (sequential + parallel orchestration). Prototypes that stay readable as they grow.

---

## What’s intentionally missing
namel3ss is focused. Some things are not here yet — on purpose. Before using it for production systems, read: `resources/limitations.md`.

---

## Quickstart
- Quickstart guide: `docs/quickstart.md`
- Examples: `examples/`
- Learning book: `resources/books/learning_namel3ss_v0.1.0.md`
- Links: repo, docs, issues, changelog below.

---

## Core CLI (file-first)
Run an app:
```bash
n3 app.ai
```
Validate:
```bash
n3 app.ai check
```
UI manifest and actions:
```bash
n3 app.ai ui
n3 app.ai actions
```
Run Studio:
```bash
n3 app.ai studio
```
Format and lint:
```bash
n3 app.ai format
n3 app.ai lint
```

---

## Providers and secrets
namel3ss supports local and cloud providers (including Ollama and Tier-1 cloud providers). Secrets should not be stored in `.ai`. Use environment variables or a local `.env` file next to `app.ai`. Templates generated by `n3 new` include `.gitignore` rules to keep `.env` out of git.

---

## Status
namel3ss is v0.1.0-alpha. It is stable enough for early adopters, prototypes, internal tools, and learning — and it is evolving fast.

---

## Contributing
Read: `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Keep files small, focused, and disciplined. namel3ss stays readable by design.
