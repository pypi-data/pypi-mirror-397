  LLMs should read this file to understand available capabilities.

# ============================================================================
# QUICK START FOR LLMs
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Read .paircoder/context/project.md to understand this project
# 2. Read .paircoder/context/state.md to see current plan/task status
# 3. Check if any flows apply to the user's request
# 4. Execute the appropriate capability
#
# ============================================================================

# Where to find context
context_files:
  project: .paircoder/context/project.md
  workflow: .paircoder/context/workflow.md
  state: .paircoder/context/state.md

# Where to find other resources
directories:
  flows: .paircoder/flows/
