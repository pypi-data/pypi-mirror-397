## Email 1: The Quick Win – Automate Your CPT Compliance

**Subject:** Stop Paying Humans $50/Hour for CPT Checks – Automate It Instead

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I hope this note finds you well. I’m reaching out because many telehealth compliance teams still rely on manual CPT code checks – an expensive, slow process.

Our new AI-powered tool, **TeleTrust Guard**, instantly validates medical CPT codes and telehealth interactions for just **$0.50 per check**. That’s a huge saving compared to the ~$50/hour compliance officers typically cost for the same task.

In real terms, TeleTrust can catch regulatory issues (HIPAA, AB-688, etc.) in milliseconds, with audit-grade evidence for every decision. No more all-nighters combing through transcripts – let the AI handle it and flag only the real issues to you.

Would a 15-minute demo next week be of interest to see how this could reduce your compliance workload by 90% while cutting costs?

Best regards,
Michael @ TeleTrust

## Email 2: The Case Study – Proven Results in Healthcare AI

**Subject:** How [Peer Company] Cut Compliance Costs by 70%

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Following up on my last email – I thought you might like a real example. One of our clients, a mid-size telehealth platform, integrated TeleTrust Guard and saw a **70% reduction in compliance review costs** in the first month.

Their compliance officers went from reviewing every conversation to focusing only on the 5% of interactions that TeleTrust flagged as high-risk. Everything else? Automatically cleared with citations to state and federal regs for proof.

What’s different about TeleTrust? It’s not just another filter. It uses a **deterministic AI engine** (we call it the Rhythm Engine) that never “forgets” regulations, even in long chats. It cross-checks every AI-generated response against HIPAA, state laws, and internal policies in real-time. If something’s not compliant, TeleTrust blocks it – period.

The result is peace of mind and audit-ready logs for every patient interaction. I’d love to share the full story and see if we can do the same for you. Are you available for a short call or demo?

Cheers,
Michael

## Email 3: The Final Nudge – De-Risking Compliance Completely

**Subject:** Closing the Loop – Your Compliance “Insurance” Policy

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I know schedules are hectic, so I’ll be brief. TeleTrust is essentially insurance for your AI compliance. Even if your providers or AI assistants slip up, our system catches mistakes **100% of the time** before they reach patients.

It’s a fail-safe layer that has never had a HIPAA breach or AB-688 violation in testing – we designed it to fail **CLOSED**, meaning it would rather block an output than ever allow a risky one through.

If ensuring flawless compliance (while saving money) is still a priority, let’s set up a call. And if now isn’t the right time, no worries – I appreciate your consideration and am here whenever you’re ready.

Thank you,
Michael
