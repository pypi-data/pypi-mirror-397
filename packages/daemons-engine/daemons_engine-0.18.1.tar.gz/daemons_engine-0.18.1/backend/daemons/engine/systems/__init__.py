# backend/app/engine/systems/__init__.py
"""
Game systems - extracted from WorldEngine for modularity.

Each system handles a specific domain of game logic:
- TimeEventManager: Scheduled events, recurring timers
- EventDispatcher: Event creation and routing to players
- CombatSystem: Attack, damage, death, loot handling
- EffectSystem: Buffs, debuffs, DoT effects
- CommandRouter: Command parsing and handler routing
- TriggerSystem: Room-based reactive triggers
- StateTracker: Dirty tracking and persistence (Phase 6)
- AuthSystem: Authentication and authorization (Phase 7)
- d20: Centralized D20 tabletop RPG mechanics
