# Skeleton Champion - A warrior-type NPC demonstrating Phase 14 ability system
# Uses BruteAI behavior for aggressive melee combat with abilities

id: npc_skeleton_champion
name: Skeleton Champion
description: >
  A towering skeletal warrior clad in rusted but once-magnificent plate armor.
  It grips a massive two-handed battleaxe, the blade still keen despite ages
  of decay. Unholy flames burn in its empty eye sockets, and ancient runes
  etched into its bones pulse with dark energy. This is no mere animated
  corpse - it was a mighty warrior in life and remains deadly in undeath.
