# Forest Guardian - A nature-themed NPC demonstrating Phase 14 ability system
# Uses TacticalCasterAI for intelligent spell selection based on situation

id: npc_forest_guardian
name: Forest Guardian
description: >
  A towering figure of intertwined vines, bark, and glowing moss stands before
  you. Its form is vaguely humanoid, with two deep green orbs serving as eyes.
  Ancient leaves rustle as it moves, and the air around it smells of earth and
  growing things. This is no mere plant - it is a sentient protector of the
  forest, awakened to defend its domain against intruders.
