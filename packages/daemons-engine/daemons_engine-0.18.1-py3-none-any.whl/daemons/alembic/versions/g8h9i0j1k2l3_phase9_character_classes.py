Phase 9a: Domain Models & Database

This migration documents the Phase 9 character system schema that is stored
in the existing Player.data JSON column. No new tables are created - all
character data (class, level, experience, resources, abilities) is stored
as JSON within the player record.

Player.data JSON Schema (Phase 9):
{
    # Existing fields (backward compatible)
    "character_class": "warrior",  # Old style, deprecated
    "level": 5,                    # Old style, deprecated

    # Phase 9 new fields
    "class_id": "warrior",         # Class template ID
    "experience": 1200,             # Class-specific XP
    "learned_abilities": [
        "slash",
        "power_attack",
        "rally"
    ],
    "ability_loadout": [
        {
            "slot_id": 0,
            "ability_id": "slash",
            "last_used_at": 1234567890.5,
            "learned_at": 1
        },
        {
            "slot_id": 1,
            "ability_id": "power_attack",
            "last_used_at": 1234567885.2,
            "learned_at": 5
        }
    ],
    "resource_pools": {
        "health": {
            "current": 100,
            "max": 120,
            "last_regen_tick": 1234567890.5
        },
        "rage": {
            "current": 50,
            "max": 100,
            "last_regen_tick": 1234567890.5
        }
    }
}

Migration Notes:
- No database schema changes (data stored as JSON)
- Backward compatible: existing players without "class_id" continue to work
- New players will have character_sheet created on class selection
- One-time migration function will convert old players to new schema
- ClassSystem runtime manager loads class/ability templates from YAML
