"""
TimeEventManager - Handles scheduled events and time-based callbacks.

Provides:
- Priority queue-based event scheduling
- Recurring events with automatic rescheduling
- Event cancellation by ID
- Efficient sleep-based loop (not busy-polling)

Extracted from WorldEngine for modularity.
