"""
Clan System for Phase 10.2

Manages persistent player clans with:
- Leader and officer hierarchy
- Rank-based permissions
- Clan experience and leveling
- Database persistence
- Member contribution tracking

Design:
- O(1) clan lookups via clan_id_map
- O(n) member operations (typically small groups)
- Async DB loading and saving
- Rank-based permission enforcement
