FactionSystem - Persistent faction management with reputation tracking (Phase 10.3)

Handles:
- Loading factions from database
- Caching NPC faction memberships for O(1) lookup
- Player reputation tracking (-100 to +100)
- Alignment tier calculation (hated > disliked > neutral > liked > revered)
- NPC behavior changes based on player standing
- Faction chat broadcasting
