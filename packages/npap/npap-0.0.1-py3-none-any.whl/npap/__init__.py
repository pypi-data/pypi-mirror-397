"""
Network Partitioning & Aggregation Package (NPAP)

A Python library for partitioning and aggregation of spatial network graph-based data with focus on electrical
power systems. The system operates on NetworkX graphs and implements a strategy pattern throughout, enabling
extensibility for new partitioning algorithms, aggregation methods, and physical constraint handling.
