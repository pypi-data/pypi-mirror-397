    Acquires exclusive lock to prevent race conditions when multiple worker processes attempt concurrent

    Uses size-based selective locking to balance performance and safety:
    - Small files (< 64MB): No lock - minimizes overhead for high-volume operations
    - Large files (≥ 64MB): Exclusive lock - prevents wasteful concurrent writes

    This approach avoids distributed lock overhead on parallel filesystems like Lustre
    when syncing millions of small files, while still protecting expensive large file transfers.
