### Running the Dashboard

```bash
# Start the API server
squadron server

# In another terminal, start the frontend
cd dashboard
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to access the dashboard.

<!-- 🎥 RECORDING PLACEHOLDER: Dashboard Demo -->
<!-- TODO: Add screen recording showing navigation through dashboard pages -->
> **Recording needed:** Walkthrough of dashboard pages - Home → Agents → Console → Missions → Settings

---

## 🐝 Swarm 2.0 — Multi-Agent Orchestration

Squadron's Swarm system enables intelligent, autonomous agent coordination.

<!-- 🖼️ SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Swarm routing in action -->
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot/recording showing task routing between agents -->
> **Screenshot needed:** Dashboard showing a task being routed from user → Overseer → Agent

### Key Features

- **🧠 LLM-Powered Routing** — Gemini decides which agent handles each task
- **🤝 Agent Handoffs** — Agents can delegate tasks to each other with context
- **📋 Task Queue** — Priority-based task management
- **🔗 Delegation Chain** — Full tracking of task ownership

```python
# Example: Intelligent task routing
from squadron.swarm import route_task

result = route_task("Analyze the API performance and deploy the fix")
# Swarm routes to the best agent for each subtask
```

---

## 💬 Agent Communication

Agents can now communicate with each other through your ticket system.

<!-- 🖼️ SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Agent-to-Agent Communication -->
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of ticket with agent @mentions and responses -->
> **Screenshot needed:** Jira/Linear ticket with agent comments showing @mentions

### Features

- **@Mention Support** — Tag agents in ticket comments to request help
- **`reply_to_ticket()`** — Agents post updates directly on tickets
- **`tag_agent()`** — Request help from specific agents
- **Auto-Wake** — Overseer wakes agents when tickets are assigned

```bash
# Overseer monitors and auto-wakes agents
squadron overseer --auto-wake

# Example ticket comment that triggers an agent:
# "@YourAgent please review the authentication changes"
```

---

## 🧠 Persistent Memory (Hippocampus)

Agents now have long-term memory powered by ChromaDB semantic search.

<!-- 🖼️ SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Memory in action -->
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of agent recalling past context in conversation -->
> **Screenshot needed:** Console showing agent recalling relevant past conversations

### Memory Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Conversation** | Past chat history with context |
| **Task** | Completed tasks and their outcomes |
| **Learning** | Insights and knowledge gained |
| **General** | Miscellaneous memories |

### API

```python
from squadron.memory import remember, recall, get_context_for_task

# Store a memory
remember("User prefers TypeScript over JavaScript", agent="Atlas")

# Recall relevant memories
memories = recall("coding preferences", agent="Atlas")

# Get context for a new task
context = get_context_for_task("Set up the new frontend", agent="Atlas")
```

---

## 🧬 Evolution Layer

Squadron agents can evolve and improve their skills over time.

<!-- 🖼️ SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Skill Registry -->
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of skill evolution/registry view -->
> **Screenshot needed:** Dashboard showing skill registry with versions and quality scores

### Features

- **Skill Registry** — Track all skills with version history
- **Quality Scoring** — Success/failure rate tracking
- **Version Control** — Rollback to previous skill versions
- **Skill Creation** — Agents can propose new skills

---

## ⏰ Wake Protocol

The Wake Protocol orchestrates autonomous agent execution.

<!-- 🎥 RECORDING PLACEHOLDER: Wake Protocol Demo -->
<!-- TODO: Add recording showing ticket detection → agent wake → task execution → report -->
> **Recording needed:** Full flow of Overseer detecting ticket → waking agent → executing → reporting back

```bash
# Manually trigger the Wake Protocol
squadron wake --summary "Deploy the hotfix to production"

# Auto-wake runs automatically with overseer
squadron overseer --auto-wake --interval 30
```

### Flow

1. **Trigger** — New ticket detected or manual wake command
2. **Route** — Swarm selects the best agent for the task
3. **Execute** — Agent completes the work
4. **Report** — Results posted back to the ticket

```bash
$ squadron report --msg "Refactored the auth module." --ticket "KAN-1"

🚀 Squadron Bridge Activated...
✅ Slack: Message sent to #general
✅ Jira: Comment added to KAN-1
```

**One command. Multiple integrations. Zero context switching.**

<!-- 🎥 RECORDING PLACEHOLDER: CLI Demo -->
<!-- TODO: Add recording showing squadron report, broadcast, and pr commands -->
> **Recording needed:** Terminal showing `squadron report`, `squadron broadcast`, and `squadron pr` commands

## 😤 The Problem

You're building with AI agents. They're powerful. They can write code, refactor systems, and solve complex problems.

But here's the frustrating reality:

| What You Want | What Actually Happens |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Agent finishes a task | You don't know unless you check the terminal |
| Jira ticket should update | It stays in "To Do" forever |
| Team needs visibility | They have no idea what the AI is building |
| Agent A needs Agent B's help | They can't communicate |
| Agent worked on this before | It doesn't remember |

**Your agents are trapped in a chat window.** They can think, but they can't *act* in your team's workflow.

---

## ✨ The Solution

Squadron is a **bridge** that connects your local AI agents to your team's real tools.

```
┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│   AI AGENTS     │         │   YOUR TEAM     │
│  (Your Agents)  │         │                 │
│                 │         │  📋 Jira/Linear │
│  "Task done!"   │────────▶│  💬 Slack       │
│                 │Squadron │  🔔 Discord     │
│  🧠 Memory      │ Bridge  │  🐙 GitHub      │
│  🔄 Handoffs    │         │  🎮 Dashboard   │
└─────────────────┘         └─────────────────┘
```

**Squadron gives your agents:**
- 🗣️ **A Voice** — Post updates to Slack/Discord
- ✋ **Hands** — Update Jira tickets, create GitHub PRs
- 👀 **Awareness** — Overseer watches for new assignments
- 🧠 **Memory** — Remember past work and context
- 🤝 **Collaboration** — Hand off tasks to each other
- 🎮 **Control** — Real-time dashboard for management

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install squadron-agents
```

### 2. Configure

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
# Required: LLM Provider
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key

# Jira
JIRA_SERVER=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
JIRA_TOKEN=your-api-token

# Slack
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token

# Discord (optional)
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token

# GitHub (optional)
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your-token

# Linear (optional)
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_...
```

### 3. Initialize

```bash
squadron init
```
This creates a `squadron/knowledge/` folder in your project. Customize `TEAM.md` and `ROLES.md` here.

### 4. Learn

```bash
squadron learn
```
This scans your code and builds a map for the agent to use.

### 5. Test

```bash
squadron report --msg "Hello from Squadron!" --channel "#general"
```

If you see `✅ Slack: Message sent` — you're live! 🎉

## 🌟 The Origin Story

Squadron was born out of necessity.

We're building [BlackCircleTerminal](https://blackcircleterminal.com), a quantitative trading platform managed by AI agents. Our virtual developers — **Marcus** (Strategy) and **Caleb** (Data) — needed a way to communicate with us when we weren't at the keyboard.

We realized that for agents to be truly useful, they need to be part of the **workflow**, not just the **code editor**.

Squadron is the nervous system that connects our AI workforce to our human tools.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Squadron has a comprehensive test suite with mocked dependencies for fast, reliable tests.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=squadron --cov-report=html

# Run only unit tests (fast)
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Run integration tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

Tests run automatically on push/PR via GitHub Actions. See `tests/README.md` for details on fixtures and writing new tests.
