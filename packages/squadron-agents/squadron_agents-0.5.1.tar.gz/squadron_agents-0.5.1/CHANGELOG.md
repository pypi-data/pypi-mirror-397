## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-11
*(Caleb - 02:45 AM EST)*
### Added
- **Autonomous Quant Skills**:
    - `find_strategy_videos`: Agent autonomously searches YouTube for new alpha.
    - `run_backtest`: Agent runs Python backtests validation.
    - `get_market_data`: Agent checks Alpaca price feeds.
- **Intelligent Auditor**:
    - **Smart EOD (3:30 PM)**: Switched from "Close All" to "Swing vs Cut" decision logic based on PnL/Charts/Time.
    - **Daily Optimizer (4:30 PM)**: Auto-triggers research if daily win rate is < 50%.

> [!NOTE]
> **Notes for Marcus**:
> 1. **Dashboard UI**: The backend now supports a `SWING` status for signals. Please ensure the frontend `LedgerPage` and `OpenSignals` components correctly display/filter trades with `status="SWING"`. They might currently disappear if the query blindly filters for `OPEN`.
> 2. **Reporting**: The Daily Optimizer posts reports to Slack/Discord. You might want to pipe these into a "Strategy Lab" view on the dashboard eventually.
