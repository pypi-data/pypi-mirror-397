#
# A GitHub Actions workflow configuration file for Continuous Integration (CI).
#
# Notes
# - The workflow includes jobs for linting, testing, building distributions,
#   and publishing releases to GitHub and PyPI.
# - The workflow is hardened by removing global permissions and setting per-job
#.  scopes.
# - To harden workflow security, global permissions are absent, and per-job
#   permissions are set as needed.
# - External action references are each pinned to a specific commit SHA for
#   improved security and stability (e.g., reduced supply-chain attack risks).
