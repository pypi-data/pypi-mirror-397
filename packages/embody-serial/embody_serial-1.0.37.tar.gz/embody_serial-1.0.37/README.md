## Features

- Connects to an EmBody device over the serial port
- Uses the EmBody protocol to communicate with the device
- Integrates with [the EmBody Protocol Codec](https://github.com/aidee-health/embody-protocol-codec) project
- Asynchronous send without having to wait for response
- Synchronous send where response message is returned
- Send facade for protocol agnostic communication with device
- Provides callback interfaces for incoming messages, response messages and connect/disconnect
- All methods and callbacks are threadsafe
- Separate threads for send, receive and callback processing
- Type safe code using [ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/) for type checking

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Access to private Aidee Health repositories on Github

## Installation

You can install _Embody Serial_ via [pip]:

```console
$ pip install embody-serial
```

This adds `embody-serial` as a library, but also provides the CLI application with the same name.

## Usage

A very basic example where you send a message request and get a response:

```python
from embodyserial.embodyserial import EmbodySerial
from embodyserial.helpers import EmbodySendHelper

embody_serial = EmbodySerial()
send_helper = EmbodySendHelper(sender=embody_serial)
print(f"Serial no: {send_helper.get_serial_no()}")
embody_serial.shutdown()
```

## Logging

This library uses Python's standard logging module and follows best practices for libraries:

### For Library Users

The library is **silent by default** - it won't produce any output unless you configure logging. To enable logging from the library:

```python
import logging

# Enable INFO level logging for embodyserial
logging.getLogger('embodyserial').setLevel(logging.INFO)
logging.getLogger('embodyserial').addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())

# Or configure specific modules
logging.getLogger('embodyserial.embodyserial').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### For CLI Users

The CLI configures logging automatically. Use `--log-level` to control verbosity:

```bash
embody-serial --get serialno --log-level DEBUG
```

Available levels: CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG (default: WARNING)

## Using the application from the command line

The application also provides a CLI application that is automatically added to the path when installing via pip.

Once installed with pip, type:

```
embody-serial --help
```

To see which options are available.

> **Note**
> The serial port is automatically detected, but can be overridden by using the `--device` option.

### Example - List all attribute values

```shell
embody-serial --get-all
```

### Example - Get serial no of device

```shell
embody-serial --get serialno
```

### Example - List files over serial port

```shell
embody-serial --list-files
```

### Example - Set time current time (UTC)

```shell
embody-serial --set-time
```

### Example - Download files

```shell
embody-serial --download-files
```

## Troubleshooting

### I get an error message saying 'no module named serial' or similar

This is a known issue and is usually caused by one of two things.

#### Ensure you haven't installed `serial` or `jserial`

Embody-serial uses the `pyserial` library. Run `pip list` to see if either the `serial` or `jserial` library is installed. If they are, remove them with `pip uninstall serial`.

#### Problems with pyserial

Sometimes, for whatever reason, it is necessary to re-install pyserial. Perform a `pip uninstall pyserial` and then `pip install pyserial` to see if this helps.
