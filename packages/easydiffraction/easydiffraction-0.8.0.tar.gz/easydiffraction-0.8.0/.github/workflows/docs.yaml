# This workflow builds and deploys documentation for the project.
#
# Steps overview:
#  Job 1: build-docs
#   - Builds documentation (including running Jupyter notebooks to generate output cells).
#   - Uploads the built site as a Pages artifact.
#  Job 2: deploy-dev
#   - Deploys the built site to GitHub Pages for development (pushes to develop/master).
#  Job 3: deploy-prod
#   - Deploys the built site to gh_pages branch for production (release tags starting with v*).
#   - This triggers deployment to a custom domain via webhook.
#
# The action summary page will contain links to the built artifact for downloading
# and inspecting, as well as links to both the development and production versions of
# the deployed documentation site.
