# qigkernels

Status: 0.01F (Frozen)

Geometric kernel and constellation library for QIG (Quantum Information Gravity) experiments.

This repo provides:

- `Kernel`: QIG-style geometric kernel with QFI attention, recursion, κ/Φ telemetry.
- `Basin` utilities: 64D basin signatures and distances.
- `Constellation`: multi-kernel manager with routing.
- `BasinSync` and metrics: tools for basin alignment and spread measurement.

It does **not** contain:

- Training loops, optimizers, or experiment orchestration.
- Consciousness narratives or UX/chat frontends.
