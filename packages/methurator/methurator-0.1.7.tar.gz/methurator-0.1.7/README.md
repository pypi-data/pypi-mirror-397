**Methurator** is a Python package designed to estimate **sequencing saturation** for **reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)** data.

Although optimized for RRBS, **methurator** can also be used for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (**WGBS**) or other genome-wide methylation data (e.g. **EMseq**). However, this data we advise you to use [Preseq package](https://smithlabresearch.org/software/preseq/).

## 1. Dependencies and Notes

- methurator uses [SAMtools](https://www.htslib.org/) and [MethylDackel](https://github.com/dpryan79/MethylDackel) internally for BAM subsampling, thus they need to be installed.
- When `--genome` is provided, the corresponding FASTA file will be automatically fetched and cached.
- Temporary intermediate files are deleted by default unless `--keep-temporary-files` is specified.

## 2. Installation

You can install **methurator** in several ways:

### **Option 1: Install via pip**

```bash
pip install methurator
```

### **Option 2: Install via BioConda**

```bash
conda create -n methurator_env bioconda::methurator
conda activate methurator_env
```

### **Option 3: Use the BioContainer**

```bash
docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/methurator:0.1.7--pyhdfd78af_0
docker run quay.io/biocontainers/methurator:0.1.7--pyhdfd78af_0 methurator -h
```

---

## 3. Quick Start

### Step 1 — Downsample BAM files

The `downsample` command performs BAM downsampling according to the specified percentages and coverage.

```bash
methurator downsample --fasta tests/data/genome.fa tests/data/Ecoli.csorted.bam
```

This command generates three summary files:

- **CpG summary** — number of unique CpGs detected in each downsampled BAM
- **Reads summary** — number of reads in each downsampled BAM
- **Summary yml** - a YAML file which contains all data above in a single file. It also contains run metadata for the sake of reproducibility.

Example outputs can be found in [`tests/data`](https://github.com/VIBTOBIlab/methurator/tree/main/tests/data).

### Step 2 — Plot the sequencing saturation curve

Use the `plot` command to visualize sequencing saturation:

```bash
methurator plot \
  --summary tests/data/methurator_summary.yml
```

## 5. Example Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Downsample BAM file
methurator downsample --genome hg19 my_sample.bam

# Step 2: Plot saturation curve
methurator plot \
  --summary output/methurator_summary.yml
```

Finally, you will get (within the output/plots) directory an html file containing the sequencing saturation plot, similarly to the following example (also available as interactive html file [here](https://github.com/VIBTOBIlab/methurator/tree/main/docs/images/example.html)):

## 6. How do we compute the sequencing saturation?

To calculate the **sequencing saturation** of an RRBS sample, we adopt the following strategy. For each sample, we downsample it according to 4 different percentages (default: `0.1,0.25,0.5,0.75`). Then, we compute the number of **unique CpGs covered by at least 3 reads** and the **number of reads** at each downsampling percentage.

We then fit the following curve using the `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` function:

$$
y = \beta_0 \cdot \arctan(\beta_1 \cdot x)
$$

We chose the **arctangent function** because it exhibits an **asymptotic growth** similar to sequencing saturation.
For large values of $\text{x}$ (as $\text{x} \to \infty$), the asymptote corresponds to the theoretical maximum number of **unique CpGs covered by at least 3 reads** and can be computed as:

$$
\text{asymptote} = \beta_0 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}
$$

Finally, the **sequencing saturation value** can be calculated as following:

$$
\text{Saturation} = \frac{\text{Number of unique CpGs (≥3 counts)}}{\text{Asymptote}}
$$

This approach allows estimation of the theoretical **maximum number of CpGs** that can be detected given an infinite sequencing depth, and quantifies how close the sample is to reaching sequencing saturation.
