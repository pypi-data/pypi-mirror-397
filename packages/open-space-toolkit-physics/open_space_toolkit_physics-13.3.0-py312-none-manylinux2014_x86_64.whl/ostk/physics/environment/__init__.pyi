                Abstract base class for ephemeris models.
    
                An ephemeris provides the position and orientation of celestial objects
                as a function of time. This is the base class for various ephemeris
                implementations including Analytical and SPICE-based ephemerides.

                    Analytical: Analytical ephemeris using reference frames.
