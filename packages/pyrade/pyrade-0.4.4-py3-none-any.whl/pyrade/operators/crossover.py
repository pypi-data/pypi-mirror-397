        ----------
        population : ndarray, shape (pop_size, dim)

class BinomialCrossover(CrossoverStrategy):
    """
    Binomial crossover: u_ij = v_ij if rand() <= CR or j == j_rand, else x_ij
    
    Most common crossover in DE. Each dimension is independently crossed
    with probability CR.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    CR : float, default=0.9
        Crossover probability (0 <= CR <= 1)
    
    Notes
    -----
    Higher CR values lead to more exploitation (more from mutant),
    lower CR values lead to more exploration (more from parent).
    At least one dimension is always crossed over to ensure the trial
    differs from the target.

    Notes

    a geometric distribution with parameter CR.

    A simple crossover strategy where each dimension has equal probability
    of coming from either parent or mutant.
    
    Notes
    -----
    This is a special case of binomial crossover with CR=0.5,

class ArithmeticCrossover(CrossoverStrategy):
    """
    Arithmetic crossover: weighted linear combination of parent and mutant.
    
    Creates trial vectors as a weighted average: trial = alpha * mutant + (1-alpha) * parent
    This creates offspring that lie on a line between parent and mutant vectors.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, default=0.5
        Weighting factor (0 <= alpha <= 1)
        alpha=0.5 means equal weight to both
        alpha=1.0 means take mutant entirely
        alpha=0.0 means take parent entirely
    adaptive : bool, default=False
        If True, alpha is randomly sampled for each individual
    
    Notes
    -----
    Arithmetic crossover is useful for:
    - Real-valued optimization (continuous domains)
    - Maintaining feasibility when parents are feasible
    - Smoother exploration of search space
    - Better preservation of numerical properties
    
    Examples
    --------

class ThreePointCrossover(CrossoverStrategy):
    """
    Three-point crossover: exchanges three segments between parent and mutant.
    
    Randomly selects three crossover points and alternates between parent and
    mutant vectors. This creates more diverse offspring than single-point crossover.
    
    Process:
    1. Select three random positions
    2. Segment: [0:p1] from one, [p1:p2] from other, [p2:p3] from first, [p3:] from other
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    None
    
    Notes
    -----
    Three-point crossover is useful for:
    - Maintaining building blocks of intermediate size
    - More diversity than two-point crossover
    - Better mixing of parent and mutant characteristics
    - Discrete optimization problems
    
    The crossover ensures good mixing while preserving some contiguous
    segments from both parents.

    --------
    >>> crossover = ThreePointCrossover()
