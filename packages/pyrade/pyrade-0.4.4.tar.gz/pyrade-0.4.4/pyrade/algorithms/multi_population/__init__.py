"""
Multi-Population and Ensemble DE Variants.

This module will contain DE algorithms using multiple populations
or ensemble strategies. Coming soon:

- Island Model DE (multiple isolated populations with migration)
- Cooperative Coevolution DE (decomposition-based)
- Ensemble DE (multiple strategies running in parallel)
- Distributed DE (parallel population processing)

These algorithms are designed for large-scale and complex problems.
