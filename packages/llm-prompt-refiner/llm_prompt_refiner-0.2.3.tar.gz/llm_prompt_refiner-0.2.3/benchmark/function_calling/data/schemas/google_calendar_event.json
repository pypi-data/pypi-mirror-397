This function allows you to programmatically add events to a user's Google Calendar, perfect for scheduling appointments, meetings, reminders, deadlines, and any time-based activities. The created event will appear in the specified calendar with full details including title, description, start/end times, location, attendees, and more. You can set up recurring events, add video conferencing links (Google Meet), invite attendees who will receive email notifications, set reminders, and customize visibility. The event supports rich descriptions with formatting, attachment links, and timezone handling. Perfect for appointment booking systems, meeting schedulers, event management applications, calendar integrations, automated scheduling workflows, and any scenario where you need to create calendar entries programmatically.",

For other calendars, use the calendar's unique identifier which looks like 'abc123@group.calendar.google.com' or an email address for user calendars. You can get calendar IDs from the Calendar List API. The user must have write access to the specified calendar, or the request will fail. Using 'primary' is the simplest and most reliable option for personal calendars. For shared team calendars or domain calendars, you'll need the specific calendar ID."

For appointments, include confirmation numbers, special instructions, or things to bring. For deadlines, include deliverables or requirements.

Include timezone information in the timestamp or specify it separately in the 'timeZone' field using IANA timezone names (e.g., 'America/Los_Angeles', 'Europe/London', 'Asia/Tokyo'). For all-day events, use 'date' field instead (format: 'YYYY-MM-DD') and omit 'dateTime'. Google Calendar will handle timezone conversions automatically - users see the event in their local timezone while it's stored with the specified timezone. Always be explicit about timezone to avoid confusion for events with attendees in different locations."

The end time must be after the start time, or the API will return an error. For typical meetings and appointments, set this to the expected duration (e.g., 1 hour after start for a 1-hour meeting). For all-day events, use the 'date' field with the next day (all-day events are exclusive of the end date). Google Calendar will show the duration and busy/free status based on this time. If you're unsure of the exact end time, err on the side of longer duration - users can always end early, but overrunning is more problematic."

If you provide a structured address, Google Calendar will show a map and offer navigation options on mobile devices. For virtual meetings, consider including the meeting link in both the location field and the description for easy access. Maximum length is 1024 characters.

You can invite both Google account users (who get full Calendar integration) and non-Google users (who receive email invitations). Be mindful of privacy when sharing event details with multiple attendees. For large events or meetings with many participants, consider whether all invitees need the full details or if some should be optional attendees."

Each reminder object has a 'method' field ('email' for email notifications or 'popup' for in-app/browser notifications) and a 'minutes' field indicating how many minutes before the event to trigger the reminder (e.g., 30 for 30 minutes before, 1440 for 1 day before).
