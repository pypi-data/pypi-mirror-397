# Welcome to Nexus

Nexus is a multi-tenant platform for managing AI agents, skills, resources, and workspaces.

## Getting Started

### Workspaces
Workspaces are your personal project areas where you can organize files, documents, and resources. This is your default workspace.

### Agents
Agents are AI assistants that can help you with various tasks. You can:
- Create agents with different permission levels
- Grant agents access to specific skills, connectors, and resources
- Configure agents to work with different AI platforms (LangGraph, Claude ADK, etc.)

### Skills
Skills are reusable capabilities that agents can use. Available skills include:
- **skill-creator**: Create and manage new skills
- **pdf**: Process PDF documents
- **docx**: Work with Word documents
- **xlsx**: Handle Excel spreadsheets
- **pptx**: Process PowerPoint presentations
- **internal-comms**: Internal communication tools

### Resources
Resources are files and data that you can share with agents. Store your documents, data files, and other assets in the `/resource` folder.

### Memory
The memory system allows agents to store and retrieve information across conversations. Access it via the `/memory` folder.

## Next Steps

1. **Explore your workspace**: Upload files and organize your projects here
2. **Create an agent**: Go to the Agents page to set up your first AI assistant
3. **Upload skills**: Add custom skills to extend agent capabilities
4. **Connect integrations**: Set up connectors to external services
