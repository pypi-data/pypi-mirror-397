Brain-Score Language is a platform to evaluate computational models of language on their match to behavioral and neural
measurements in the domain of language processing. The intent of Brain-Score is to adopt many (ideally all) the
experimental benchmarks in the field for the purpose of model testing, falsification, and comparison. To that end,
Brain-Score operationalizes experimental data into quantitative benchmarks that any model candidate following
the `BrainModel` interface can be scored on.

See the [Documentation](https://brain-score-language.readthedocs.io) for more details.

Brain-Score is made by and for the community. To contribute,
please [send in a pull request](https://github.com/brain-score/language/pulls).

## Alpha status
This repository is under active development, and should be considered to be in an alpha status.
Code is likely to change substantially, without backwards compatibility.
Please let us know of any problems by [creating an issue](https://github.com/brain-score/language/issues/new).

## Setup

```bash
python -m pip install -e "." # change "." to ".[test]" to include testing dependencies
```

Please note that plugins (models, benchmarks, data, and metrics) may require additional dependencies beyond those installed here. Default behavior will install these dependencies directly into the runtime environment. 

To avoid conflicts, we encourage either using an environment manager or setting the `BS_INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES` environment variable to either `no` or `newenv` (e.g. `export BS_INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES=newenv`). 

`no` will leave all dependency installation up to the user, whereas `newenv` will create a new `conda` environment for the duration of the run. If you would like to use the `newenv` option and do not already have `conda` installed, you can follow the installation instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

## Usage

Score an existing model on an existing benchmark:

```bash
python brainscore_language score --model_identifier='distilgpt2' --benchmark_identifier='Futrell2018-pearsonr'
```
