Toms Structures documentation
=============================

Welcome to the documentation for **Toms Structures!**

``toms-structures`` is an unofficial python package companion to AS 3700 2018 Masonry Structures. ``toms-structures`` can be
used to determine masonry element capacities in accordance with AS 3700.

Check out the :doc:`quickstart` section for further information.


Features
--------

- Compression and bending capacity of unreinforced clay / concrete masonry
- Bending capacity of RC blocks


Why does this project exist?
----------------------------

Many structural engineers in Australia rely on a combination of industry software / excel spreadsheets / hand calculations. It is common for an excel spreadsheet to be passed around with variable amounts of documentation, little or no testing, and no verification that the spreadsheet was not broken at some point in the past. Efforts to fix these issues exist and there certainly are quality excel spreadsheets, but it is generally difficult to achieve and requires outsized organisational efforts to maintain. This project aims to replace some of those excel spreadsheets. 

Project goals:
--------------

1. Provide extensive testing so that outputs are reliable. 
2. Provide thorough documentation so that structural engineers without extensive software engineering training can clearly understand how calculations are performed, what the intended use cases are, what the limitations of the project are, and how they can raise issues/contribute.


.. note::
   This project is under active development.
