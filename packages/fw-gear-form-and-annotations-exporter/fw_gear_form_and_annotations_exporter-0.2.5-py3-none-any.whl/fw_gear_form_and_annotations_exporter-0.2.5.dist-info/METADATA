- [ ] Analysis

## Usage

The Form and Annotation Exporter gear is executed by ensuring the following
configuration parameters are provided and are in a valid combination. This gear has no
file inputs. This gear requires that the Reader Task Workflow be enabled on the instance
it is run on.

If an `ohif_config.json` is being used to configure the OHIF Viewer, and you are
using it to capture form responses outside of the Reader Task workflow, you cannot use
this gear to retrieve the form responses from the sessions. See the [Example of
Retrieving Form-Responses from Session Variables](#example-of-retrieving-form-responses-from-session-variables)
section for anexample of how to do this.

If the gear is run within a project for a protocol where the *protocol_name* is
not defined, the gear will fail.

For the *annotations-scope* configuration parameter, the following combinations are valid:

- `task` and `both` settings require a valid *protocol_name* for a protocol defined
  within the project.
- `non-task` and `none` settings do not require a valid *protocol_name*. This allows for
  the export of annotations and form responses that are not associated with a task.
- if both *-scope* settings are set to `none`, the gear will fail as there will be no
  output.

For the *form-responses-scope*  configuration parameter, the following combinations are valid:

- `task` and `none` are the only valid combinations

Running this gear under a specific subject, session, or acquisition will constrain the
output to only those tasks, form-responses, and annotations that are associated with
the container and its children.

Gear versions 0.2.3 and before only return form responses attached to a file. As of
version 0.2.4, form responses not associated with a file may be returned. If utilizing
reader tasks attached to non-file level containers, use version 0.2.4 or above.

This gear will output select annotation properties for the following annotation types:

- Ellipse
- Circle
- Rectangle
- Freehand/Contour (closed)
- Length
- Annotate (Arrow)
- Bidirectional
- Angle

The gear will output the following annotation properties if available in the tool type:

- Area
- Length
- Angle
- Units (of measurement)
- min/max X/Y coordinates of a bounding box of the annotation
- perpendicular min/max X/Y of a Bidirectional annotation
- ShortestDiameter/LongestDiameter of a Bidirectional annotation

### Inputs

This gear has no file input. The exported form responses and annotations will depend
on the level at which the gear is launched (e.g. project, subject, session, acquisition)
and the confiugration options selected.

### Config

- *debug*
  - **Type**: *boolean*
  - **Description**: *Log debug messages*
  - **Default**: *False*
- *protocol_name*
  - **Type**: *string*
  - **Description**: *The name of the protocol to export data from.*
  - **Optional**: *True*
- *annotations-scope*
  - **Type**: *string*
  - **Description**: *The scope of the exported annotations.*
  - **Default**: *task*
- *form-responses-scope*
  - **Type**: *string*
  - **Description**: *The scope of the form responses.*
  - **Default**: *task*
- *read_timeout*
  - **Type**: *integer*
  - **Description**: *The maximum time in seconds to wait for a response from the server.*
  - **Default**: *60*

### Outputs

The Form and Annotations Exporter gear has the following outputs:

- form-responses-\<datestamp\>.csv
- annotations-\<datestamp\>.csv

For form responses and annotations that are coordinated with a task, the above outputs
will correspond to the same Task ID and the `Location` column of the annotations CSV
will correspond to the matching `Question` with a `Answer` of `yes`. The question will
take the form of `<question #>: <Location>` (e.g. `2: LV`).

Both output CSV files are in a "narrow" format where each row represents a single form
response Question/Answer or annotation Property/Value pair. Each of these CSV files can
be converted to a "wide" format using the `pandas` Python library with the [`pivot`
command](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pivot.html). A
[data dictionary](./data_dictionary.csv) is provided for the CSV files.

#### Example Conversion to Wide Format

```python
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
root_dir = Path('~')
# Read in the CSV file
form_responses_path = root_dir / 'form-responses-2023-05-13_08-47-26.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(form_responses_path)
index_cols = [col for col in list(df.columns) if col not in ['Question', 'Answer']]
df_wide = df.pivot(index=index_cols, columns='Question', values='Answer').reset_index()
df_wide.to_csv(root / (form_responses_path.stem + '_wide.csv'))

# Read in the CSV file
annotations_path = root_dir / 'annotations-2023-05-13_08-47-26.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(annotations_path)
index_cols = [col for col in list(df.columns) if col not in ['Property', 'Value']]
df_wide = df.pivot(index=index_cols, columns='Property', values='Value').reset_index()
df_wide.to_csv(annotations_path.stem + '_wide.csv')
```

#### Example of Merging Form Responses and Annotations

```python
import pandas as pd

annotations_wide_df = pd.read_csv('annotations-2023-05-13_08-47-26_wide.csv')
form_responses_wide_df = pd.read_csv('form-responses-2023-05-13_08-47-26_wide.csv')

# Ensure that the common columns have the same datatypes
form_responses_wide_df=form_responses_wide_df.astype(object)
annotations_wide_df=annotations_wide_df.astype(object)

# Get the common columns between the two dataframes
common_columns = set(annotations_wide_df.columns)
common_columns = list(common_columns.intersection(set(form_responses_wide_df.columns)))
common_columns = [
  col for col in common_columns if col not in ['Created', 'Modified','Revision']
]

# Acquisition and File Name may not be common columns
common_columns = [
    col
    for col in common_columns
    if col not in ["Acquisition Label", "acquisition.id", "File Name", "file.id"]
]

# Merge the two dataframes on the common columns
merged_df = pd.merge(
  annotations_wide_df, 
  form_responses_wide_df, 
  on=list(common_columns), 
  how="outer"
)

# More than one annotation per task.id will produce multiple rows for the same task.id
merged_df.to_csv('merged_annotations_and_form_responses.csv')
```

The columns of each CSV output are described below.

#### **form-responses-\<datestamp\>.csv**

On form-response-scope being `task`, `non-task`, or `both` and a non-empty response,
the gear will output a CSV file containing the form responses for the specified
protocol.

The file name will be prefixed with `form-responses-` and suffixed with the datestamp
of the export (e.g. `form-responses-2023-05-13_08-47-26.csv`). The CSV will contain the
following columns:

#### Example of Retrieving Form-Responses from Session Variables

When session forms have been filled outside of the Reader Task Workflow (i.e.
using a `ohif_config.json` stored that the project leve), the form
responses are stored in the session custom info variable (`session.info`).

You can export the responses in 2 ways:

  1. Using a [DataView](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/4536056285075)
  to export as columns the responses you need.

  2. Using the SDK. For instance, the script below can be used to retrieve the form
  responses from the session info and convert them to a CSV file.

  ```python
  import flywheel
  import os
  import json
  import pandas as pd

  api_key = os.environ['FW_LATEST_KEY']
  client = flywheel.Client(api_key)

  group="your_group"
  project_label="form_and_annotation_export_project"
  project = client.lookup(f"{group}/{project_label}")

  read_df = pd.DataFrame()
  df_indx = 0
  for session in project.sessions.iter():
      info = session.reload().info
      reads = info.get("ohifViewer", {}).get("read", {})
      reader_keys = info.get("ohifViewer", {}).get("read", {}).keys()
      for reader in reader_keys:
          read_df.at[df_indx, "session_id"] = session.id
          read_df.at[df_indx, "session_label"] = session.label        
          read_df.at[df_indx, "reader"] = reader
          read_df.at[df_indx, "date"] = reads.get(reader, {}).get("date", {})
          read_df.at[df_indx, "readTime"] = reads.get(reader, {}).get("readTime", {})
          read_df.at[df_indx, "readStatus"] = reads.get(reader, {}).get("readStatus", {})
          for k,v in reads.get(reader, {}).get("notes", {}).items():
              read_df.at[df_indx, k] = v
          df_indx += 1

  read_df.to_csv("read_df.csv", index=False)
  ```
