# fpfind

An add-on implementation of frequency compensation for [qcrypto](https://github.com/s-fifteen-instruments/qcrypto).

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install fpfind
```

Requirements:

* Python 3.8 and above, running in Linux
* `gcc` (if running `freqcd`, preferably in PATH for auto-compilation)

The stable releases are tagged and listed [here](https://github.com/s-fifteen-instruments/fpfind/tags).

## Usage

Binaries and scripts are defined in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) and will be exposed to the path; commonly used scripts are listed below.

```bash
# For general timestamp viewing
parse-timestamps {TIMESTAMPS}
show-timestamps {TIMESTAMPS}

# For frequency compensation (and in context of coincidence finding)
fpfind -t {TIMESTAMPS1} -T {TIMESTAMPS2}
freqcd -X -udF fpipe -f 568 < {TIMESTAMPS}
[costream -V5 ... |] freqservo -V5 -udF fpipe -f 568
```

See [Hints](./docs/user/hints.md) for usage hints.

## Upgrading

See [Migration](./docs/user/migration.md) for moving between major versions, e.g. v2 to v3.

## Motivation

Quantum key distribution requires some form of clock synchronization to retain high signal-noise ratio when pairing photon detection/generation events. This is usually achieved by having a stable clock (e.g. Rb clock, GPS receiver) or a separate clock transfer channel.

Timing correlated photons used in the QKD itself can also be used as a resource for clock synchronization, by identifying and tracking the timing delay $\tau$ using the second-order coherence $g^{(2)}(\tau)$. The timing drift in the signal indicates a frequency offset/drift between the two parties, which can be corrected with a feedback loop. This opens up the use of clock references with weaker frequency stability like quartz clocks.

This library implements the frequency compensation modules supplementing the core [qcrypto](https://github.com/s-fifteen-instruments/qcrypto) QKD software stack, and a reference usage can be found in [QKDServer](https://github.com/s-fifteen-instruments/QKDServer).

## Schematic

Components for frequency compensation (implemented in this library) are highlighted in yellow below.

![](docs/qcrypto_fpfind.png)

In particular:

* `freqcd.c` performs frequency correction
* `fpfind.py` replaces `pfind.c` for initial frequency estimation
* `freqservo.py` performs frequency drift estimation

## Limitations

* The FFT buffer size is limited to 2**31 bins due to the implicit casting to `int32` performed internally by `np.bincount` on older versions of `numpy`. This corresponds to a buffer order value upper bounded to `q = 31` for `fpfind`. To bypass this limitation, supply an alternative implementation for `np.bincount`.

## Troubleshooting

Certain issues may appear when attempting an install on RaspbianOS:

* Importing `numpy` yields the error message stating `libopenblas.so` could not be found (this is the underlying linear algebra library for Numpy); installing the `libopenblas-dev` library fixes this, e.g. `apt install libopenblas-dev`

## Contributing

Version tags (as of **v2**) follow [romantic versioning](https://romversioning.github.io/romver/) (a variation on semantic versioning). In the SemVer language: PATCH is incremented for non-breaking changes, MINOR for breaking changes that are easy to patch downstream, and MAJOR is reserved for large breaking changes that require careful syntax adjustments.

Dynamic versioning is handled by poetry, so bumping the version simply involves adding a lightweight git tag (with "v" prepended, e.g. `git tag {VERSION} [COMMIT]`). Local version modifiers (e.g. dates) are removed for compatibility with PyPI rules.

Commit messages to roughly follow [Angular commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) (which aligns with the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)). The type should be one of the following: **feat**, **fix**, **chore**, **test**, **docs**, **build**, **ci**.
If a scope is provided, it should be one of:

* **fpfind**
* **fpplot**
* **freqcd**
* **freqservo**
* **parser** (for both timestamp and epoch)

Commit messages can be automatically checked using `pre-commit`, after installing:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
