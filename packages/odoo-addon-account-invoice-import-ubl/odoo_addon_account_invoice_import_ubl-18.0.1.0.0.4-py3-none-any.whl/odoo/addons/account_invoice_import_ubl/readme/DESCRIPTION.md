This module is an extension of the module *account_invoice_import* to
add the ability to import UBL XML invoices. The [UBL (Universal Business
Language)](http://ubl.xml.org/) standard is a XML standard for business
documents (invoices, purchase orders, etc...) created by
[OASIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OASIS_%28organization%29)
(Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards).
The UBL standard became the [ISO/IEC
19845](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=66370)
standard in December 2015 (cf the [official announce](https://www.prweb.com/releases/oasis_ubl_universal_business_language_standard_approved_by_iso_and_iec/prweb13186919.htm)).
