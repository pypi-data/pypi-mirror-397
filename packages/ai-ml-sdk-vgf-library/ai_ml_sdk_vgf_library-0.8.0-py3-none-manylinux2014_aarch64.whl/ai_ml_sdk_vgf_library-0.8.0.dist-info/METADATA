# ML SDK VGF Library

The VGF Library is a library that encodes and decodes VGF files. The VGF format
covers the entire model use cases. These use cases can be a combination of
SPIR-V™ module binary data, their constants, and compute shaders. The library
provides a suite of APIs and tools for working with VGF files. The library
includes the following:

- C++ encoder API
- C++ decoder API
- C decoder API
- VGF dumping tool: `vgf_dump`
- VGF updating tool: `vgf_updater`

The encoder provides a simple, high-level API for building up VGF files. It is
designed for easy integration into offline tooling.

The decoder is designed to be lightweight and to be included in high-performing
programs, for example game engines. Therefore, the decoder does not allocate any
dynamic memory on its own. To maintain full control, you must allocate the
memory required and provide it to this library. To minimize copies and peak
memory requirements, the format also supports mmap read operations on the
contents.

VGF Library also provides a dumping tool which is called vgf_dump. vgf_dump
prints the content of a VGF file into human-readable JSON format. You can also
use vgf_dump to generate scenario file templates. You can use the scenario file
templates with the
[Scenario Runner](https://github.com/arm/ai-ml-sdk-scenario-runner) tool.

The VGF Updater rewrites an existing VGF file to the latest VGF format
version supported by the VGF library. The new version of the VGF file is
written to the provided output path.

To see the contents of a VGF file in a visual format, you can use the
[VGF Adapter for Model Explorer](https://github.com/arm/vgf-adapter-model-explorer),
which lets you view the inputs, outputs, constants and SPIR-V™ graphs.

## Cloning the repository

To clone the ML SDK VGF Library as a stand-alone repository, you can use regular
git clone commands. However, for better management of dependencies and to ensure
everything is placed in the appropriate directories, we recommend using the
`git-repo` tool to clone the repository as part of the ML SDK for Vulkan®
suite. [Repo tool](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo).

For a minimal build and to initialize only the ML SDK VGF Library and its
dependencies, run:

```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/arm/ai-ml-sdk-manifest -g vgf-lib
```

Alternatively, to initialize the repo structure for the entire ML SDK for
Vulkan®, including the VGF Library, run:

```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/arm/ai-ml-sdk-manifest -g all
```

After the repo is initialized, fetch the contents with:

```bash
repo sync --no-clone-bundle
```

### Cloning on Windows®

To ensure nested submodules do not exceed the maximum long path length, you must
enable long paths on Windows®, and you must clone close to the root directory
or use a symlink. Make sure to use Git for Windows.

Using **PowerShell**:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" -Name "LongPathsEnabled" -Value 1
git config --global core.longpaths true
git --version # Ensure you are using Git for Windows, for example 2.50.1.windows.1
git clone <git-repo-tool-url>
python <path-to-git-repo>\git-repo\repo init -u <manifest-url> -g all
python <path-to-git-repo>\git-repo\repo sync --no-clone-bundle
```

Using **Git Bash**:

```bash
cmd.exe "/c reg.exe add \"HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem"" /v LongPathsEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f"
git config --global core.longpaths true
git --version # Ensure you are using the Git for Windows, for example 2.50.1.windows.1
git clone <git-repo-tool-url>
python <path-to-git-repo>/git-repo/repo init -u <manifest-url> -g all
python <path-to-git-repo>/git-repo/repo sync --no-clone-bundle
```

After the sync command completes successfully, you can find the ML SDK VGF
Library in `<repo_root>/sw/vgf-lib/`. You can also find all the dependencies
required by the ML SDK VGF Library in `<repo_root>/dependencies/`.

## Building VGF Library from source

The build system must have:

- CMake 3.22 or later.
- C/C++ 17 compiler: GCC, or optionally Clang on Linux and MSVC on Windows®.
- Python 3.10 or later. Required python libraries for building are listed in
  `tooling-requirements.txt`.
- Ninja 1.10 or later.

The following dependencies are also needed:

- [Argument Parser for Modern C++](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse).
- [JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).
- [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).
- [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest). Optional, for testing.

For the preferred dependency versions see the manifest file.

## Building with the script

To make the build configuration options easily discoverable, we provide a python
build script. When you run the script from a git-repo manifest checkout, the
script uses default paths and does not require any additional arguments. If you
do not use the script, you must specify paths to the dependencies.

To build on the current platform, for example on Linux or Windows®, run the
following command:

```bash
python3 $SDK_PATH/sw/vgf-lib/scripts/build.py -j $(nproc)
```

To cross compile for AArch64 architecture, add the following option:

```bash
python3 $SDK_PATH/sw/vgf-lib/scripts/build.py -j $(nproc) --target-platform aarch64
```

To enable and run tests, use the `--test` option. To lint the tests, use the
`--lint` option. To enable tests and documentation building python dependencies
must be installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r tooling_requirements.txt
```

To build the documentation, use the `--doc` option. To build the documentation,
you must have `sphinx` and `doxygen` installed on your machine.

You can install the build artifacts for this project into a specified location.
To install the build artifacts, pass the `--install` option with the required
path.

To create an archive with the build artifacts option, you must add the
`--package` option. The archive is stored in the provided location.

For more command line options, see the help output:

```bash
python3 $SDK_PATH/sw/vgf-lib/scripts/build.py --help
```

## PyPI

The ML SDK VGF Library is available on PyPI as the [ai-ml-sdk-vgf-library](https://pypi.org/project/ai-ml-sdk-vgf-library/) package.

Install:

```bash
pip install ai-ml-sdk-vgf-library
```
