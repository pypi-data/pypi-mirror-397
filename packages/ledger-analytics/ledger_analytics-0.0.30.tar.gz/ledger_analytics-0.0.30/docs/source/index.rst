LedgerAnalytics Python
===========================

LedgerAnalytics Python is the Python interface to `Korra <https://korra.com>`_'s
analytics infrastructure. Our analytics API endpoints allow easy access to Ledger's suite of
reliable, scalable and state-of-the-art insurance data science models and data structures.
LedgerAnalytics Python efficiently makes HTTP requests to these endpoints, integrating with
our `lower-level software ecosystem <ecosystem.rst>`_, and handling all the complex
dependencies so you don't have to. Get set up in minutes by `requesting
an API key <apikeys.rst>`_, `installing the package <installation.rst>`_, 
and checking out the `Quick Start <quickstart.rst>`_ page.

How it works
----------------

Ledger's analytics endpoints provide a secure remote compute service to our
modeling infrastructure. There are a variety of plans available for individuals
through full data science teams. See the `Pricing <pricing.rst>`_ page for more
details.

   LedgerAnalytics is currently in beta phase, and we are currently looking for beta testers!
