# Jvav

Useful tools for crawling study resources. Supports Python library operations and command-line usage, with additional proxy options and cache support.

## INSTALL

```
# python >= 3.9
pip install jvav -U
```

## LIB

- DmmUtil
- JavDbUtil
- JavLibUtil
- JavBusUtil
- AvgleUtil
- MagnetUtil
- SukebeiUtil
- WikiUtil
- TransUtil
- RankUtil

```py
# A sample for DmmUtil
import jvav

util = jvav.DmmUtil()
util.get_nice_avs_by_star_name('小倉由菜')
util.get_score_by_id('cawd-441')
util.get_all_top_stars()
```

## CMD

```shell
usage: cmd.py [-h] [-v] [-av1 AV1] [-av2 AV2] [-av3 AV3] [-auth AUTH] [-nc] [-uc] [-sr SR] [-srn SRN] [-tg TG] [-pv1 PV1] [-pv2 PV2] [-rk1] [-rk2] [-p PROXY]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Check version
  -av1 AV1              Followed by a code, search this code on JavBus
  -av2 AV2              Followed by a code, search this code on Sukebei
  -av3 AV3              Followed by a code, search this code on JavDb
  -auth AUTH            Followed by a authentication code for JavBus, use it if you failed to search from Javbus, get the code from cookie key: bus_auth
  -nc                   Filter out high-definition subtitles magnet links
  -uc                   Filter out uncoded magnet links
  -sr SR                Followed by an actress name, get a list of high-rated codes based on the actress name
  -srn SRN              Followed by an actress name, get a list of the most recent codes based on the actress name
  -tg TG                Followed by a keyword, search for codes based on the keyword
  -pv1 PV1              Followed by a code, get the corresponding preview video of the code on DMM
  -pv2 PV2              Follow a code, get the corresponding preview video of the code on Avgle
  -rk1                  Get the top 25 ranking of DMM actresses
  -rk2                  Get the top 25 ranking of AVs
  -p PROXY, --proxy PROXY
                        Followed by a proxy server address (by default reads the value of the environment variable http_proxy)
```

## DEV

I use python-3.9.13 for development, please use python <= 3.9. 

And it is recommended to use python virtual environment to avoid some unnecessary problems.

Here is my developing steps:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/akynazh/jvav.git
cd jvav
~/.pyenv/versions/3.9.13/bin/python -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

And then you can enjoy coding! Remember to write or run test cases in `tests/test.py`.
Please make sure the test is okay before submitting your code~

## TODO

The following are some functions to be implemented, and I look forward to your contribution~ 

- [ ] support db.msin.jp
- [x] support RankUtil in CMD (Thanks: [@akynazh](https://github.com/akynazh))
- [x] cache the successful query results locally (Thanks: [@akynazh](https://github.com/akynazh))
- [x] support javdb.com (Thanks: [@Steven-Fake](https://github.com/Steven-Fake))
- [x] support JavDbUtil in cmd (Thanks: [@akynazh](https://github.com/akynazh))
