## 📋 Current Version: 0.20.0 LTS (Long-Term Stable)

**🎉 v0.20.0 is the Long-Term Stable (LTS) release!** This version marks the stabilization of SpecFact CLI's core analysis and enforcement capabilities.

**SpecFact 0.20.0 LTS focuses on what it does best: analyzing legacy code and enforcing contracts.** This LTS release is production-ready and will receive bug fixes and security updates until v1.0 GA.

| Capability | Status | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Code Analysis** | ✅ Stable | Reverse engineer legacy code into documented specs |
| **Gap Detection** | ✅ Stable | Find missing tests, contracts, and documentation |
| **Contract Enforcement** | ✅ Stable | Prevent regressions with runtime validation |
| **API Contract Testing** | ✅ Stable | Validate OpenAPI specs with Specmatic |
| **AI IDE Bridge** | ✅ New | Generate prompts for Cursor, Copilot, Claude |
| **Code Generation** | ⚠️ Deprecated | Coming in v1.0 with AI-assisted workflow |

**Need code generation?** Use the new bridge commands to get AI-ready prompts:

```bash
# Get AI prompt to fix a gap
specfact generate fix-prompt GAP-001 --bundle legacy-api

# Get AI prompt to generate tests
specfact generate test-prompt src/auth/login.py
```

These prompts work with any AI IDE (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, etc.) - you control the code generation, SpecFact validates the results.

## 🚀 Quick Start in 60 Seconds

### Install in 10 seconds

```bash
# Zero-install (recommended)
uvx specfact-cli

# Or install with pip (upgrade if already installed)
pip install -U specfact-cli
```

### Your first command (< 60 seconds)

```bash
# Modernizing legacy code? (Recommended)
specfact import from-code legacy-api --repo .

# Starting a new project?
specfact plan init legacy-api --interactive

# Using GitHub Spec-Kit or other tools?
specfact import from-bridge --repo . --adapter speckit --write
```

That's it! 🎉

> **Need machine-readable artifacts?** Use `specfact --output-format json …` (or the per-command `--output-format` flag) to emit plan bundles and reports as JSON instead of YAML.

## What is SpecFact CLI?

A brownfield-first CLI that **analyzes your legacy code** to find gaps, then **enforces contracts** to prevent regressions during modernization.

**Stop vibe coding. Start shipping quality code with contracts.** SpecFact automatically extracts specs from existing code, finds missing tests and contracts, then enforces them as you modernize—preventing bugs before they reach production.

**Perfect for:** Teams modernizing legacy Python systems, data pipelines, DevOps scripts

**For teams that can't afford production bugs during migration.**

### 🎯 Built for Real-World Agile Teams

SpecFact isn't just a technical tool—it's designed for **real-world agile/scrum teams** with role-based workflows:

- 👤 **Product Owners** → Export backlog with DoR checklists, prioritization, dependencies, and sprint planning
- 🏗️ **Architects** → Export technical constraints, protocols, contracts, architectural decisions, and risk assessments
- 💻 **Developers** → Export implementation tasks, code mappings, test scenarios, and Definition of Done criteria

**Each role works in their own Markdown files** (no YAML editing), and SpecFact syncs everything together automatically. Perfect for teams using agile/scrum practices with clear role separation.

## Why SpecFact?

### **Love GitHub Spec-Kit? SpecFact Adds What's Missing**

**Use both together:** Keep using Spec-Kit for new features, add SpecFact for legacy code modernization.

| What You Need | Spec-Kit | SpecFact CLI |
|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **Work with existing code** | ⚠️ Designed for new features | ✅ **Reverse-engineer legacy code** |
| **Prevent regressions** | ⚠️ Documentation only | ✅ **Runtime contract enforcement** |
| **Find hidden bugs** | ⚠️ LLM suggestions (may miss) | ✅ **Symbolic execution** (CrossHair) |
| **Automated safety net** | ⚠️ Manual code review | ✅ **CI/CD gates** (GitHub Actions) |

**Perfect together:**

- ✅ **Spec-Kit** for new features → Fast spec generation with Copilot
- ✅ **SpecFact** for legacy code → Runtime enforcement prevents regressions
- ✅ **Bidirectional sync** → Keep both tools in sync automatically
- ✅ **GitHub Actions** → SpecFact integrates with your existing GitHub workflows

**Bottom line:** Spec-Kit is great for documenting new features. SpecFact is essential for modernizing legacy code safely. Use both together for the best of both worlds.

## 💡 Key Capabilities

### Technical Capabilities

- ✅ **Reverse engineer legacy code** → Extract specs automatically from existing code
- ✅ **Runtime contract enforcement** → Prevent regressions during modernization
- ✅ **Symbolic execution** → Discover hidden edge cases with CrossHair
- ✅ **API contract testing** → Validate OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specs with Specmatic integration
- ✅ **Works offline** → No cloud required, fully local
- ✅ **CLI integrations** → Works seamlessly with VS Code, Cursor, GitHub Actions, and any agentic workflow

### Team Collaboration Capabilities

- ✅ **Persona-based workflows** → Product Owners, Architects, and Developers work in parallel on their own sections
- ✅ **Agile/scrum alignment** → Definition of Ready (DoR), story points, dependencies, prioritization, sprint planning
- ✅ **Role-specific exports** → Each persona gets a tailored Markdown view with only what they need
- ✅ **Git-native collaboration** → Conflicts resolved in human-readable Markdown, not brittle YAML
- ✅ **Real-world templates** → Templates designed by agile coaches to match actual team expectations

---

## 👥 Team Collaboration: Persona-Based Workflows

SpecFact enables **real-world agile/scrum teams** to work together seamlessly with role-based workflows:

```bash
# Product Owner: Export backlog for sprint planning
specfact project export --bundle legacy-api --persona product-owner
# → Exports: DoR checklists, prioritization, dependencies, business value, sprint planning

# Architect: Export technical design
specfact project export --bundle legacy-api --persona architect
# → Exports: Technical constraints, protocols, contracts, architectural decisions, NFRs

# Developer: Export implementation details
specfact project export --bundle legacy-api --persona developer
# → Exports: Tasks, code mappings, test scenarios, Definition of Done

# Each role edits their Markdown, then imports back
specfact project import --bundle legacy-api --persona product-owner --source backlog.md
```

**Why this matters:**

- ✅ **No YAML editing** → Everyone works in familiar Markdown
- ✅ **Parallel workflows** → Product Owners, Architects, and Developers work simultaneously
- ✅ **Git-native** → Conflicts resolved in Markdown (human-readable), not YAML
- ✅ **Agile/scrum ready** → Built-in DoR validation, dependency tracking, sprint planning

## 🔌 CLI Integrations

SpecFact CLI works with your existing tools—no new platform to learn. See real bugs that were caught and fixed through different integrations:

- ✅ **VS Code** - Catch async bugs before you commit
- ✅ **Cursor** - Prevent regressions during AI-assisted refactoring
- ✅ **GitHub Actions** - Block bad code from merging
- ✅ **Pre-commit Hooks** - Validate code locally before pushing
- ✅ **AI Assistants** - Find edge cases AI might miss

👉 **[Integration Showcases](docs/examples/integration-showcases/)** - Real examples of bugs fixed via CLI integrations

**Core USP**: Pure CLI-first approach—works offline, no account required, zero vendor lock-in. Regularly showcases successful integrations that fix bugs not detected by other tools.

### 🤖 AI IDE Bridge (New in 0.17)

SpecFact now generates prompts you can use with any AI IDE for code generation:

```bash
# 1. Analyze your code to find gaps
specfact analyze gaps --bundle legacy-api

# 2. Generate AI prompt to fix a specific gap
specfact generate fix-prompt GAP-001

# 3. Copy prompt to your AI IDE (Cursor, Copilot, Claude)
# 4. AI generates the fix
# 5. Validate with SpecFact
specfact enforce sdd --bundle legacy-api
```

**Why this approach?**

- ✅ **You control the AI** - Use your preferred AI IDE and model
- ✅ **SpecFact validates** - Ensure AI-generated code meets contracts
- ✅ **No lock-in** - Works with Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, or any AI tool

## See It In Action

We ran SpecFact CLI **on itself** to prove it works with legacy code:

- ⚡ Analyzed 32 legacy Python files → Discovered **32 features** and **81 stories** in **3 seconds**
- 🚫 Set enforcement to "balanced" → **Blocked 2 HIGH violations** (as configured)
- 📊 Compared manual vs auto-derived plans → Found **24 deviations** in **5 seconds**

**Total time**: < 10 seconds | **Total value**: Found real naming inconsistencies and undocumented features in legacy codebase

## Optional Telemetry (Opt-In)

- Telemetry is **off by default** and only activates if you set `SPECFACT_TELEMETRY_OPT_IN=true` or create `~/.specfact/telemetry.opt-in`.
- When enabled, SpecFact records anonymized metrics (e.g., number of features detected, contract violations blocked) to help us publish aggregate stats such as “contracts prevented 70% of the bugs surfaced during modernization.”
- Data is stored locally in `~/.specfact/telemetry.log`, and you can route it to your own OpenTelemetry collector via `SPECFACT_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`.
- Learn more in [`docs/reference/telemetry.md`](docs/reference/telemetry.md).
