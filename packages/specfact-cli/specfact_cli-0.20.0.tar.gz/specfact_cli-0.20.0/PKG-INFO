           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

## 📋 Current Version: 0.20.0 LTS (Long-Term Stable)

**🎉 v0.20.0 is the Long-Term Stable (LTS) release!** This version marks the stabilization of SpecFact CLI's core analysis and enforcement capabilities.

**SpecFact 0.20.0 LTS focuses on what it does best: analyzing legacy code and enforcing contracts.** This LTS release is production-ready and will receive bug fixes and security updates until v1.0 GA.

| Capability | Status | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Code Analysis** | ✅ Stable | Reverse engineer legacy code into documented specs |
| **Gap Detection** | ✅ Stable | Find missing tests, contracts, and documentation |
| **Contract Enforcement** | ✅ Stable | Prevent regressions with runtime validation |
| **API Contract Testing** | ✅ Stable | Validate OpenAPI specs with Specmatic |
| **AI IDE Bridge** | ✅ New | Generate prompts for Cursor, Copilot, Claude |
| **Code Generation** | ⚠️ Deprecated | Coming in v1.0 with AI-assisted workflow |

**Need code generation?** Use the new bridge commands to get AI-ready prompts:

```bash
# Get AI prompt to fix a gap
specfact generate fix-prompt GAP-001 --bundle legacy-api

# Get AI prompt to generate tests
specfact generate test-prompt src/auth/login.py
```

These prompts work with any AI IDE (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, etc.) - you control the code generation, SpecFact validates the results.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start in 60 Seconds

### Install in 10 seconds

```bash
# Zero-install (recommended)
uvx specfact-cli

# Or install with pip (upgrade if already installed)
pip install -U specfact-cli
```

### Your first command (< 60 seconds)

```bash
# Modernizing legacy code? (Recommended)
specfact import from-code legacy-api --repo .

# Starting a new project?
specfact plan init legacy-api --interactive

# Using GitHub Spec-Kit or other tools?
specfact import from-bridge --repo . --adapter speckit --write
```

That's it! 🎉

> **Need machine-readable artifacts?** Use `specfact --output-format json …` (or the per-command `--output-format` flag) to emit plan bundles and reports as JSON instead of YAML.

---

## What is SpecFact CLI?

A brownfield-first CLI that **analyzes your legacy code** to find gaps, then **enforces contracts** to prevent regressions during modernization.

**Stop vibe coding. Start shipping quality code with contracts.** SpecFact automatically extracts specs from existing code, finds missing tests and contracts, then enforces them as you modernize—preventing bugs before they reach production.

**Perfect for:** Teams modernizing legacy Python systems, data pipelines, DevOps scripts

**For teams that can't afford production bugs during migration.**

### 🎯 Built for Real-World Agile Teams

SpecFact isn't just a technical tool—it's designed for **real-world agile/scrum teams** with role-based workflows:

- 👤 **Product Owners** → Export backlog with DoR checklists, prioritization, dependencies, and sprint planning
- 🏗️ **Architects** → Export technical constraints, protocols, contracts, architectural decisions, and risk assessments
- 💻 **Developers** → Export implementation tasks, code mappings, test scenarios, and Definition of Done criteria

**Each role works in their own Markdown files** (no YAML editing), and SpecFact syncs everything together automatically. Perfect for teams using agile/scrum practices with clear role separation.

---

## Why SpecFact?

### **Love GitHub Spec-Kit? SpecFact Adds What's Missing**

**Use both together:** Keep using Spec-Kit for new features, add SpecFact for legacy code modernization.

| What You Need | Spec-Kit | SpecFact CLI |
|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **Work with existing code** | ⚠️ Designed for new features | ✅ **Reverse-engineer legacy code** |
| **Prevent regressions** | ⚠️ Documentation only | ✅ **Runtime contract enforcement** |
| **Find hidden bugs** | ⚠️ LLM suggestions (may miss) | ✅ **Symbolic execution** (CrossHair) |
| **Automated safety net** | ⚠️ Manual code review | ✅ **CI/CD gates** (GitHub Actions) |

**Perfect together:**

- ✅ **Spec-Kit** for new features → Fast spec generation with Copilot
- ✅ **SpecFact** for legacy code → Runtime enforcement prevents regressions
- ✅ **Bidirectional sync** → Keep both tools in sync automatically
- ✅ **GitHub Actions** → SpecFact integrates with your existing GitHub workflows

**Bottom line:** Spec-Kit is great for documenting new features. SpecFact is essential for modernizing legacy code safely. Use both together for the best of both worlds.

## 💡 Key Capabilities

### Technical Capabilities

- ✅ **Reverse engineer legacy code** → Extract specs automatically from existing code
- ✅ **Runtime contract enforcement** → Prevent regressions during modernization
- ✅ **Symbolic execution** → Discover hidden edge cases with CrossHair
- ✅ **API contract testing** → Validate OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specs with Specmatic integration
- ✅ **Works offline** → No cloud required, fully local
- ✅ **CLI integrations** → Works seamlessly with VS Code, Cursor, GitHub Actions, and any agentic workflow

### Team Collaboration Capabilities

- ✅ **Persona-based workflows** → Product Owners, Architects, and Developers work in parallel on their own sections
- ✅ **Agile/scrum alignment** → Definition of Ready (DoR), story points, dependencies, prioritization, sprint planning
- ✅ **Role-specific exports** → Each persona gets a tailored Markdown view with only what they need
- ✅ **Git-native collaboration** → Conflicts resolved in human-readable Markdown, not brittle YAML
- ✅ **Real-world templates** → Templates designed by agile coaches to match actual team expectations

---

## 👥 Team Collaboration: Persona-Based Workflows

SpecFact enables **real-world agile/scrum teams** to work together seamlessly with role-based workflows:

```bash
# Product Owner: Export backlog for sprint planning
specfact project export --bundle legacy-api --persona product-owner
# → Exports: DoR checklists, prioritization, dependencies, business value, sprint planning

# Architect: Export technical design
specfact project export --bundle legacy-api --persona architect
# → Exports: Technical constraints, protocols, contracts, architectural decisions, NFRs

# Developer: Export implementation details
specfact project export --bundle legacy-api --persona developer
# → Exports: Tasks, code mappings, test scenarios, Definition of Done

# Each role edits their Markdown, then imports back
specfact project import --bundle legacy-api --persona product-owner --source backlog.md
```

**Why this matters:**

- ✅ **No YAML editing** → Everyone works in familiar Markdown
- ✅ **Parallel workflows** → Product Owners, Architects, and Developers work simultaneously
- ✅ **Git-native** → Conflicts resolved in Markdown (human-readable), not YAML

## 🔌 CLI Integrations

SpecFact CLI works with your existing tools—no new platform to learn. See real bugs that were caught and fixed through different integrations:

- ✅ **VS Code** - Catch async bugs before you commit
- ✅ **Cursor** - Prevent regressions during AI-assisted refactoring
- ✅ **GitHub Actions** - Block bad code from merging
- ✅ **Pre-commit Hooks** - Validate code locally before pushing
- ✅ **AI Assistants** - Find edge cases AI might miss

👉 **[Integration Showcases](docs/examples/integration-showcases/)** - Real examples of bugs fixed via CLI integrations

**Core USP**: Pure CLI-first approach—works offline, no account required, zero vendor lock-in. Regularly showcases successful integrations that fix bugs not detected by other tools.

### 🤖 AI IDE Bridge (New in 0.17)

SpecFact now generates prompts you can use with any AI IDE for code generation:

```bash
# 1. Analyze your code to find gaps
specfact analyze gaps --bundle legacy-api

# 2. Generate AI prompt to fix a specific gap
specfact generate fix-prompt GAP-001

# 3. Copy prompt to your AI IDE (Cursor, Copilot, Claude)
# 4. AI generates the fix
# 5. Validate with SpecFact
specfact enforce sdd --bundle legacy-api
```

**Why this approach?**

- ✅ **You control the AI** - Use your preferred AI IDE and model
- ✅ **SpecFact validates** - Ensure AI-generated code meets contracts
- ✅ **No lock-in** - Works with Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, or any AI tool
- ✅ **Quality gates** - Prevent AI hallucinations from reaching production

## See It In Action

We ran SpecFact CLI **on itself** to prove it works with legacy code:

- ⚡ Analyzed 32 legacy Python files → Discovered **32 features** and **81 stories** in **3 seconds**
- 🚫 Set enforcement to "balanced" → **Blocked 2 HIGH violations** (as configured)
- 📊 Compared manual vs auto-derived plans → Found **24 deviations** in **5 seconds**

**Total time**: < 10 seconds | **Total value**: Found real naming inconsistencies and undocumented features in legacy codebase

## Optional Telemetry (Opt-In)

- Telemetry is **off by default** and only activates if you set `SPECFACT_TELEMETRY_OPT_IN=true` or create `~/.specfact/telemetry.opt-in`.
- When enabled, SpecFact records anonymized metrics (e.g., number of features detected, contract violations blocked) to help us publish aggregate stats such as “contracts prevented 70% of the bugs surfaced during modernization.”
- Data is stored locally in `~/.specfact/telemetry.log`, and you can route it to your own OpenTelemetry collector via `SPECFACT_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`.
- Learn more in [`docs/reference/telemetry.md`](docs/reference/telemetry.md).
