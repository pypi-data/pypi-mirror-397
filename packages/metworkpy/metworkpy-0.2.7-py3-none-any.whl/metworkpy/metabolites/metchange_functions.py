    metabolites based on reaction weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        Cobra model to use for performing the metchange algorithm
    metabolites : Iterable[str]
        Metabolites to calculate consistency scores for, if None
        (default) will calculate for all metabolites in the model
    reaction_weights : dict[str, float] | pd.Series
        Weights for the reactions in the model, should correspond to the
        probability that reaction should not be active.
    objective_tolerance : float
        The tolerance for the objective value during the second
        optimization step, where the inner product of reaction weights
        and reaction fluxes is minimized. The flux for each metabolite
        will be constrained to be within objective-tolerance*objective-
        value of the unconstrained objective value for a metabolite.
        Defaults to 0.05.
    progress_bar : bool
        Whether a progress bar should be displayed

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series
        Series of inconsistency scores for all the `metabolites`

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm seeks to find an inconsistency score for metabolites based
    on gene expression. The gene expression is represented by reaction weights,
    which can be calculated by combining
    :func:`metworkpy.utils.expression_utils.expr_to_metchange_gene_weights` and
    :func:`metworkpy.gpr.gpr_functions.gene_to_rxn_weights`. The algorithm calculates the
    inconsistency score through a two part optimization. First, for a given
    metabolite, the maximum metabolite production is found. Then the metabolite
    production is constrained to stay within objective_tolerance*maximum-production of
    the maximum metabolite production, and the inner product of reaction weights,
    and reaction fluxes is minimized.
    This minimum inner product is the inconsistency score.

    Add a metchange objective to a cobra Model

    Parameters
    ----------

        Cobra model to add the metchange objective to

        String ID of metabolite to add metchange objective for
    reaction_weights : pd.Series
        Weights for each reaction, representing the probability of that
