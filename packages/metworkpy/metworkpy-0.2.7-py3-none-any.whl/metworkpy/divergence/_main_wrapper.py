    """Calculate the divergence between two distributions represented by samples p and q

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : ArrayLike
        Array representing sample from a distribution, should have shape
        (n_samples, n_dimensions). If `p` is one dimensional, it will be
        reshaped to (n_samples,1). If it is not a np.ndarray, this
        function will attempt to coerce it into one.
    q : ArrayLike
        Array representing sample from a distribution, should have shape
        (n_samples, n_dimensions). If `q` is one dimensional, it will be
        reshaped to (n_samples,1). If it is not a np.ndarray, this
        function will attempt to coerce it into one.
    discrete_method
        Method to use to calculate the divergence between two discrete
        distributions, should take two positional arguments for p and q.
    continuous_method
        Method to use to calculate the divergence between two continuous
        distributions, should take two positional arguments for p and q,
        as well as keyword arguments for n_neighbors, and metric (which
        will be a float representing a Minkowski p-norm).
    n_neighbors : int
        Number of neighbors to use for computing mutual information.
        Will attempt to coerce into an integer. Must be at least 1.
        Default 5.
    discrete : bool
        Whether the samples are from discrete distributions
    jitter : Union[None, float, tuple[float,float]]
        Amount of noise to add to avoid ties. If None no noise is added.
        If a float, that is the standard deviation of the random noise
        added to the continuous samples. If a tuple, the first element
        is the standard deviation of the noise added to the x array, the
        second element is the standard deviation added to the y array.
    jitter_seed : Union[None, int]
        Seed for the random number generator used for adding noise
    distance_metric : Union[str, float]
        Metric to use for computing distance between points in p and q,
        can be "Euclidean", "Manhattan", or "Chebyshev". Can also be a
        float representing the Minkowski p-norm.
