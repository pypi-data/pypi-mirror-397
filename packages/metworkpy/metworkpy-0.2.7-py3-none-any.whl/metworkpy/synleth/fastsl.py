    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        Cobra model to find synthetic lethal groups of genes for
    max_depth : int
        Maximum number of genes in a synthetic lethal group
    genes_of_interest : None | Iterable
        Set of genes of interest, this method will only find synthetic
        lethal groups which include at least one of these genes. Should
        be an iterable (list, set, etc.) of gene id strings, which match
        the gene ids in the model. If None, will default to all genes in
        the model. This filtering is done after the synthetic lethal
        sets are already found (see note for reason) and so is for
        convenience rather than speed.
    active_cutoff : float
        Minimum (absolute value of) flux through a reaction to be
        considered active. All reactions found to have a flux below this
        during pFBA will be ignored when finding essential genes.
    pfba_fraction_of_optimum : float
        Proportion of maximum objective maximum required to be
        maintained during pFBA. The original objective function is
        constrained to be greater than the maximum objective multiplied
        by pfba_fraction_of_optimum
    essential_proportion : float
        Proportion of maximum objective value, below which a gene knock
        out is considered growth inhibitory. A value of 0.01 indicates
        that if the maximum objective value after a gene knock out is
        less than 1% of the value before the knockout, the gene is
        essential.
    processes : int | None
        Number of processes to use during calculations, if None will use
        all available
    show_queue_size : bool
        If True will print the approximate current queue size each time
        a job is taken from the queue during calculations. Default
        False.

    Returns
    -------
    list[set[str]]
        List of synthetically lethal groups of genes, recorded as sets
        of gene ids

    Notes
    -----
    For parallel operation, 3 processes is a recommended minimum. Currently, the parallel implementation
    requires a manager process (which handles the queue of gene sets to be processed), and so if processes=2
    this will end up using only 1 core to do most of the calculation, with overhead from parallel processing
    causing this to likely be slower than serial operation. Currently, setting processes=2 will result in
    this function using 2 processes, but in future this might be changed so that it just uses the
    faster serial implementation in this case. Further, due to the relatively high overhead in the parallel
    implementation, the actual speedup granted by the parallel implementation may be relatively small
    (especially on smaller models).

    For the genes_of_interest argument, this function still needs to check all synthetic lethal groups
    exhaustively, so it will actually take longer than if this is not provided. The reason all groups
    have to be checked exhaustively is to ensure that no subsets of the group are already synthetically
    lethal. Take for example a set of genes A, B, C, D, E, F. If A and B together are essential,
    and you are interested in the gene set D,E,F, then the knock out of A,B,D would be essential.
    Even though you are interested in D, the essentiality of this gene set is caused by A and B alone.
    To ensure that all synthetic lethal gene sets are actually synthetically lethal (rather than a
    superset including irrelevant genes), the gene sets are filtered for any sets that are supersets of other
    sets. This means that it is impossible to only check sets that include genes of interest, since (like
    in the example), the genes causing the essentiality maybe outside the genes of interest.
