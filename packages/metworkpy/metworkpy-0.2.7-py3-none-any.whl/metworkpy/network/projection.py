    Parameters
    ----------
    network : nx.Graph | nx.DiGraph
        Network to project
    node_set : Iterable
        Nodes to project the graph onto
    directed : bool | None
        Whether the projected graph should be directed. If the `network`
        argument is not directed this is ignored. A value of None will
        have the directedness of the output match the directedness of
        the input network.
    weight : str | Callable[[float, float], float] | None
        How to weight the projected graph. If None, the projected graph
        will not be weighted. If "ratio", the edges will be weighted
        based on the ratio between actual shared neighbors and maximum
        possible shared neighbors. If "count", the edges will be
        weighted by the number of shared neighbors. A function can also
        be provided, which takes two float arguments (the weights of two
        edges), and returns a float.
    weight_attribute : str
        Which edge attribute in the original network to use for
        weighting. Default is 'weight'.
    reciprocal : bool
        If converting from a directed graph to an undirected one,
        whether to only keep edges that appear in both directions in the
        original directed network.

    Returns
