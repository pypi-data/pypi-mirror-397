    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ArrayLike
        Array representing sample from a distribution, should have shape
        (n_samples, n_dimensions). If ``x`` is one dimensional, it will
        be reshaped to (n_samples, 1). If it is not a np.ndarray, this
        function will attempt to coerce it into one.
    y : ArrayLike
        Array representing sample from a distribution, should have shape
        (n_samples, n_dimensions). If ``y`` is one dimensional, it will
        be reshaped to  (n_samples, 1). If it is not a np.ndarray, this
        function will attempt to coerce it into one.
    discrete_x : bool
        Whether x is discrete or continuous
    discrete_y : bool
        Whether y is discrete or continuous
    n_neighbors : int
        Number of neighbors to use for computing mutual information.
        Will attempt to coerce into an integer. Must be at least 1.
        Default 5.
    jitter : Union[None, float, tuple[float,float]]
        Amount of noise to add to avoid ties. If None no noise is added.
        If a float, that is the standard deviation of the random noise
        added to the continuous samples. If a tuple, the first element
        is the standard deviation of the noise added to the x array, the
        second element is the standard deviation added to the y array.
    jitter_seed : Union[None, int]
        Seed for the random number generator used for adding noise
    metric_x : Union[str, int]
        Metric to use for computing distance between points in x, can be
        "Euclidean", "Manhattan", or "Chebyshev". Can also be a float
        representing the Minkowski p-norm.
    metric_y : Union[str, int]
        Metric to use for computing distance between points in y, can be
        "Euclidean", "Manhattan", or "Chebyshev". Can also be a float
        representing the Minkowski p-norm.
    truncate : bool
        Whether to ensure the mutual information is positive

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The mutual information between x and y

    Notes
    -----

    - The metrics can either be provided as a float greater than 1 representing the Minkowski p-norm, or a string
      representing the name of a metric such as 'Manhattan', 'Chebyshev', or 'Euclidean'.
    - For scalar samples (samples from a 1-D distribution), all the metrics are the same.
    - In the case of two continuous distributions, the distance in the z space (i.e. the joint (X,Y) space), is
      determined by the maximum norm (||z-z\\`|| = max{||x-x\\`||, ||y-y\\`||}), see [1] for more details.
    - Always returns value in nats (i.e. mutual information is calculated using the natural logarithm.
