    Parameters
    ----------
    fluxes : pandas.Series
        A pandas series of fluxes.
    which_reactions : str
        Which reactions should be the binary values? Options are
        "active", "inactive", "forward", "reverse", or their first
        letters. Default is "active". "active" will return 1 for

        return 1 for reactions with absolute value of flux less than

        "forward" will return 1 for reactions with flux greater than

        "reverse" will return 1 for reactions with flux less than

    -----
    This doesn't account for gene expression level, to determine highly expressed reactions which are
    considered on/off, the output of this function will need to be compared with reaction weights.
