    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        The genome scale metabolic model for which to find essential
        reactions
    essentiality_threshold : float
        The proportion of optimal growth, below which a reaction
        knockout is considered essential (default 0.1)
    pfba_tolerance : 1e-7
        Value below which reaction fluxes are considered 0 (default
        1e-7)
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments passed to COBRApy's single_reaction_deletion

        to grow

    Uses parsimonious flux balance analysis filter out non-essential reactions,
    then iterates through remaining reactions to check if they are essential.
