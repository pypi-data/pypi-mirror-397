    """Calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence between two distributions represented by samples p and q

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : ArrayLike
        Array representing sample from a distribution, should have shape
        (n_samples, n_dimensions). If `p` is one dimensional, it will be
        reshaped to (n_samples,1). If it is not a np.ndarray, this
        function will attempt to coerce it into one.
    q : ArrayLike
        Array representing sample from a distribution, should have shape
        (n_samples, n_dimensions). If `q` is one dimensional, it will be
        reshaped to (n_samples,1). If it is not a np.ndarray, this
        function will attempt to coerce it into one.
    n_neighbors : int
        Number of neighbors to use for computing divergence. Will
        attempt to coerce into an integer. Must be at least 1. Default
        5.
    discrete : bool
        Whether the samples are from discrete distributions
    jitter : Union[None, float, tuple[float,float]]
        Amount of noise to add to avoid ties. If None no noise is added.
        If a float, that is the standard deviation of the random noise
        added to the continuous samples. If a tuple, the first element
        is the standard deviation of the noise added to the x array, the
        second element is the standard deviation added to the y array.
    jitter_seed : Union[None, int]
        Seed for the random number generator used for adding noise
    distance_metric : Union[str, float]
        Metric to use for computing distance between points in p and q,
        can be \"Euclidean\", \"Manhattan\", or \"Chebyshev\". Can also
        be a float representing the Minkowski p-norm.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The Jensen-Shannon divergence between p and q

    Parameters

    np.ndarray | pd.DataFrame

        p and the ith column of q. If both p and q are numpy ndarrays,
