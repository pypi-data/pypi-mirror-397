class ImageData:
    r"""Container for image bytes with calculated hashes.

    This class holds image bytes along with lists of SHA256 and MD5 hashes
    that track all transformations applied to the image. Each transformation
    that modifies the visual content (resize, format conversion) adds a new
    hash to the lists, while operations that don't change visual content
    (compression) preserve the existing hash lists.

    Important: Transformers modify ImageData objects in-place. The same object
    instance is updated with new data and hashes throughout the pipeline,
    maintaining object identity while tracking transformation history.

    Attributes:
    ----------
        data: The raw bytes of the image (modified in-place by transformers).
        image_format: The format of the image data (e.g., JPEG, PNG, RAW_UINT8).
            Updated by transformers when they change the format.
        sha256_hashes: List of SHA256 hashes tracking image transformations.
            Index 0 is the original image, subsequent indices track
            transformations.
        md5_hashes: List of MD5 hashes tracking image transformations.
            Index 0 is the original image, subsequent indices track
            transformations.

    Example:
    -------
        # Create ImageData from raw bytes
        image_bytes = b"\\x89PNG\\r\\n\\x1a\\n..."  # PNG file bytes
        image_data = ImageData(image_bytes)
        original_id = id(image_data)

        # Access the data and hash lists
        print(f"Image size: {len(image_data.data)} bytes")
        print(f"SHA256 transformations: {image_data.sha256_hashes}")
        print(f"MD5 transformations: {image_data.md5_hashes}")
        print(f"Number of transformations: {len(image_data.sha256_hashes)}")

            yield image_data

        async with AthenaClient(channel, options) as client:

                # Same object identity maintained throughout pipeline
                assert id(image_data) == original_id
                # But hash list has grown to track transformations
                print(f"Final transformations: {len(image_data.sha256_hashes)}")
