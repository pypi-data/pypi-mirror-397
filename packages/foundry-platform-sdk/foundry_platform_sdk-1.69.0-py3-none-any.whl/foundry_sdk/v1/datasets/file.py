        as `transactionRid`. The transaction must be of type `DELETE`. This is useful for deleting multiple files in a
        single transaction. See [createTransaction](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/api/datasets-resources/transactions/create-transaction/) to
        open a transaction.

        Uploads a File to an existing Dataset.
        The body of the request must contain the binary content of the file and the `Content-Type` header must be `application/octet-stream`.

        See [Datasets Core Concepts](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/data-integration/datasets/) for details on using branches and transactions.

        To **upload a file to a specific Branch** specify the Branch's identifier as `branchId`. A new transaction will
        be created and committed on this branch. By default the TransactionType will be `UPDATE`, to override this
        default specify `transactionType` in addition to `branchId`.
        See [createBranch](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/api/datasets-resources/branches/create-branch/) to create a custom branch.

        To **upload a file on a manually opened transaction** specify the Transaction's resource identifier as
        `transactionRid`. This is useful for uploading multiple files in a single transaction.
        See [createTransaction](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/api/datasets-resources/transactions/create-transaction/) to open a transaction.

        as `endTransactionRid`. This will include the most recent version of all files since the latest snapshot
        transaction, or the earliest ancestor transaction if there are no snapshot transactions.

        Note that an intermediate snapshot transaction will remove all files from the view. Behavior is undefined when
        the start and end transactions do not belong to the same root-to-leaf path.

        To **list files on a specific transaction** specify the Transaction's resource identifier as both the
        `startTransactionRid` and `endTransactionRid`. This will include only files that were modified as part of that
