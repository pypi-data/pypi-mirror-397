What is BuildGrid?
------------------

BuildGrid is a Python remote execution service which implements Google's
`Remote Execution API`_ and the `Remote Workers API`_. The project's goal is to
be able to execute build jobs remotely on a grid of computers in order to
massively speed up build times. Workers on the grid should be able to run with
different environments. It works with clients such as `Bazel`_,
`BuildStream`_ and `RECC`_, and is designed to be able to work with any client
that conforms to the above API protocols.

BuildGrid is designed to work with any worker conforming to the `Remote Workers API`_
specification. Workers actually execute the jobs on the backend while BuildGrid does
the scheduling and storage. The `BuildBox`_ ecosystem provides a suite of workers and
sandboxing tools that work with the Workers API and can be used with BuildGrid.
