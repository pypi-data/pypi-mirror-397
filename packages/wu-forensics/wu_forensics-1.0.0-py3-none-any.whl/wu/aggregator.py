"""
Epistemic aggregator for forensic dimension results.

Combines results from multiple analysis dimensions into an overall
assessment with proper epistemic reasoning. Unlike simple voting,
this aggregator respects the asymmetry between proving manipulation
and proving authenticity.

Key principle: A single INCONSISTENT finding (e.g., "iPhone 6 claiming 4K")
is sufficient for overall concern, while CONSISTENT findings merely indicate
absence of detected anomalies, not proof of authenticity.

This module also provides cross-dimension corroboration, identifying when
multiple independent analyses point toward the same conclusion. Such
convergent evidence is forensically significant because each dimension
examines different technical aspects of the file; independent agreement
strengthens the overall inference substantially.
