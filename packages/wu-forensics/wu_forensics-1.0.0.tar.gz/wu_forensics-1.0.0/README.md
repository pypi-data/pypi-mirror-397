# Wu - Epistemic Media Forensics Toolkit

Detects manipulated media with structured uncertainty output suitable for court admissibility (Daubert standard).

Named after **Chien-Shiung Wu** (1912-1997), who disproved parity conservation and found asymmetries everyone assumed didn't exist.

## Installation

```bash
pip install wu-forensics
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze a photo
wu analyze suspicious_photo.jpg

# JSON output
wu analyze photo.jpg --json

# Batch analysis
wu batch *.jpg --output reports/
```

## Python API

```python
from wu import WuAnalyzer

analyzer = WuAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze("photo.jpg")

print(result.overall)  # OverallAssessment.NO_ANOMALIES
print(result.to_json())
```

## What Wu Detects (Phase 0)

Phase 0 focuses on metadata-only analysis with zero ML dependencies:

- **Device impossibilities**: "iPhone 6 claiming 4K resolution" is physically impossible
- **Editing software signatures**: Adobe Photoshop, FFmpeg, etc.
- **AI generation signatures**: DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Sora, etc.
- **Timestamp inconsistencies**: Future dates, modification before capture
- **Stripped metadata**: Intentionally removed EXIF data

## Epistemic States

Unlike binary classifiers, Wu reports structured uncertainty:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `CONSISTENT` | No anomalies detected (not proof of authenticity) |
| `INCONSISTENT` | Clear contradictions found |
| `SUSPICIOUS` | Anomalies that warrant investigation |
| `UNCERTAIN` | Insufficient data for analysis |

## Court Admissibility

Wu is designed with the Daubert standard in mind:

1. **Testable methodology**: Every finding is reproducible
2. **Known error rates**: Confidence levels are explicit
3. **Peer review**: Academic citations throughout
4. **General acceptance**: Based on EXIF standards (JEITA CP-3451C)
