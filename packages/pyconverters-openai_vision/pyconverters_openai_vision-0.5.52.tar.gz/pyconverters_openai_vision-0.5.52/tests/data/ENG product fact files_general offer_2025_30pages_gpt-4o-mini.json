The gymnast is wearing a sparkling, intricately designed costume that features a blend of pink and beige colors, adorned with shimmering sequins and embellishments. The outfit has a fitted bodice and a flared skirt, enhancing the elegance of the movement. \n> \n> Instead of a head, there is a large, shiny pink ball positioned where the head would typically be, creating a surreal and whimsical effect.
