# PyO3 buffer overflow in PyString::from_object
# RUSTSEC-2025-0020
#
# STATUS: Accepted (Temporary)
# REASON: Blocked by pyo3-polars dependency
#
# Details:
# - pyo3-polars 0.20.0 (required for polars 0.46.0) only supports pyo3 0.23
# - pyo3-polars 0.25.0 requires polars 0.52.0, which has Rust compatibility issues
# - The vulnerability is in PyString::from_object, which we do not directly use
# - Risk is assessed as LOW for our use case
#
# Mitigation plan:
# 1. Monitor pyo3-polars and polars releases
# 2. Upgrade when polars 0.52+ stabilizes (expected within 1-2 months)
# 3. Track upstream issue: https://github.com/pola-rs/pyo3-polars/issues
#
# Last reviewed: 2025-01-20
# Review again: 2025-03-20 (or when polars 0.52+ is stable)
