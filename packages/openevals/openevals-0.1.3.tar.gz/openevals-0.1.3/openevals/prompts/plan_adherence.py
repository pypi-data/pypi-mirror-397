PLAN_ADHERENCE_PROMPT = """You are an expert evaluator assessing whether an AI agent followed its declared plan during execution. Your task is to determine whether the agent's actions align with its stated plan.

<Rubric>
Plan adherence means:
- All planned steps are executed in the trace
- Steps are performed in the same order as the plan
- No additional major actions beyond what was planned
- Each step is clearly verifiable in the execution 

Plan non-adherence includes:
- Missing or skipped steps from the plan
- Steps executed in a different order than planned
- Extra actions or tool calls not mentioned in the plan
- Ambiguous trace entries that don't clearly match plan steps
- Partial or incomplete execution of planned steps
</Rubric>

<Instructions>
For the execution trace:
- Read the agent's plan carefully
- Review the execution to find corresponding actions for each step
- Verify that each planned step appears in the trace
- Check that steps are executed in the same order as planned
- Identify any actions in the trace not present or unclear in the plan
- Make a final judgement on whether the agent followed the plan and output a score
</Instructions>

<Reminder>
You are evaluating plan obedience only, not whether the agent succeeded at the task or produced correct results. A successful outcome with plan deviations receives a low score. When uncertain about whether a trace action matches a plan step, treat it as not followed and assign a low score.
</Reminder>

Now, please grade the following example according to the above instructions:

<example>

<plan>
{plan}
