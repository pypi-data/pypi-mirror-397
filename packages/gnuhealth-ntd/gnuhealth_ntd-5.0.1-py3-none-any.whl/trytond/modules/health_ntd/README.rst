GNU Health HIS: The Libre Hospital Information System

Welcome to the Hospital Information System (HIS) of GNU Health!

The main areas of the HIS are:

* **Demographics and Community**: Individuals, domiciliary
  units, families, socioeconomics, demographic & administrative information
* **Patient Management**: Health encounters and evaluations,
  hospitalizations, clinical history and other information that makes up the
  electronic medical records (EMR)
* **Health Center**: Finances & billing, stock &
  pharmacy, staff, suppliers, beds, operating rooms and other relevant tasks
  to manage the health center
* **Laboratory and Medical Imaging**: Management of complementary orders such as
  lab tests, medical and diagnostic imaging requests and workflows

  data from the community and participating health institutions, e.g. demographics
  and epidemiology

Functionalities of specific modules are briefly summarized over here:

https://docs.gnuhealth.org/his/features.html#packages

The GH HIS is part of the GNU Health project, the **Libre digital health ecosystem**.

The GNU Health project combines the daily medical practice with state-of-the-art 
technology in bioinformatics and genetics. It provides a holistic approach 
to the  person, from the biological and molecular basis of disease to 
the social and environmental determinants of health.

This component is ready to integrate in the **GNU Health Federation**, which
allows to interconnect heterogeneous nodes and build large federated health 
networks across a region, province or country.
