            num_machines: The number of machines to run on.
            machine: The machine type to run the job on. One of {", ".join(_MACHINE_VALUES)}.
            command: The command to run inside your job. Required if using a studio. Optional if using an image.
                If not provided for images, will run the container entrypoint and default command.
            studio: The studio env to run the job with. Mutually exclusive with image.
            image: The docker image to run the job with. Mutually exclusive with studio.
            env: Environment variables to set inside the job.
            interruptible: Whether the job should run on interruptible instances. They are cheaper but can be preempted.
            cloud_account: The cloud account to run the job on.
                Defaults to the studio cloud account if running with studio compute env.
                If not provided will fall back to the teamspaces default cloud account.
            image_credentials: The credentials used to pull the image. Required if the image is private.
                This should be the name of the respective credentials secret created on the Lightning AI platform.
            cloud_account_auth: Whether to authenticate with the cloud account to pull the image.
                Required if the registry is part of a cloud provider (e.g. ECR).
            artifacts_local: The path of inside the docker container, you want to persist images from.
                CAUTION: When setting this to "/", it will effectively erase your container.
                Only supported for jobs with a docker image compute environment.
            artifacts_remote: The remote storage to persist your artifacts to.
                Should be of format <CONNECTION_TYPE>:<CONNECTION_NAME>:<PATH_WITHIN_CONNECTION>.
                PATH_WITHIN_CONNECTION hereby is a path relative to the connection's root.
                E.g. efs:data:some-path would result in an EFS connection named `data` and to the path `some-path`
                within it.
                Note that the connection needs to be added to the teamspace already in order for it to be found.
                Only supported for jobs with a docker image compute environment.
            entrypoint: The entrypoint of your docker container. Defaults to `sh -c` which
                just runs the provided command in a standard shell.
                To use the pre-defined entrypoint of the provided image, set this to an empty string.
                Only applicable when submitting docker jobs.
            path_mappings: The mappings from data connection inside your container (not supported)
            max_runtime: the duration (in seconds) for which to allocate the machine.
                Irrelevant for most machines, required for some of the top-end machines on GCP.
                If in doubt, set it. Won't have an effect on machines not requiring it.
                Defaults to 3h
            reuse_snapshot: Whether the job should reuse a Studio snapshot when multiple jobs for the same Studio are
                submitted. Turning this off may result in longer job startup times. Defaults to True.
