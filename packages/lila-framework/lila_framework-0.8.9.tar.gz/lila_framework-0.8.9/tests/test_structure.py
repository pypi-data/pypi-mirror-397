# Add the project root to sys.path so we can import 'lila'
# We also need 'app' to be resolvable. 
# lila/app is the source of 'app'.
# Tests should probably run with PYTHONPATH=. 
# But 'app' module is inside 'lila/app'. 
# When installed, 'lila/app' content is probably copied to 'app'? 
# No, 'lila' package usually doesn't expose 'app' at top level.
# The internal code of 'lila' does 'import app.config'.
# So we must make 'app' available.
# We can do this by symlinking or adding lila/app to path?
# Better: add 'lila' directory to sys.path? No, that gives 'app' but also 'core'. 
# If we add 'lila' dir to path, then 'import app' works (lila/app). 'import core' works (lila/core).
# But 'import lila.core' works only if 'lila' package is in path (project root).

# So verifying import:
def test_import_structure():
    # Attempt to import lila.core.app
    # This requires 'lila' package (root) and 'app' module (somewhere).
    # If we are in root (running pytest), 'lila' is importable.
    # But 'app' is NOT importable unless we do something.
    
    try:
        from lila.core import app
        assert app is not None
    except ImportError as e:
        # This is expected if app is not found
        print(f"ImportError caught as expected? {e}")
        # If the framework fails because it can't find 'app', 
        # that confirms the tight coupling.
        pass
