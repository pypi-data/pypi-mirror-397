"""DEPRECATED: Legacy provider interface protocols for Flow SDK.

⚠️  DEPRECATION NOTICE ⚠️
These interfaces are DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future version.

MIGRATION GUIDE:
- Replace IComputeProvider/IStorageProvider with ProviderProtocol from flow.protocols.provider
- Extend ProviderAdapter from flow.adapters.providers.adapter instead of implementing protocols directly
- Use ProviderInitProtocol from flow.protocols.provider_init instead of IProviderInit
- Use RemoteOperationsProtocol from flow.protocols.remote_operations instead of IRemoteOperations

NEW ARCHITECTURE:
- ProviderProtocol: Unified interface for all provider operations
- ProviderAdapter: Base class with common functionality
- ProviderInitPort: Separate interface for provider initialization
- RemoteOperationsPort: Interface for remote task operations

Legacy interfaces maintained temporarily for backward compatibility:
  - IComputeProvider: GPU instance lifecycle management → Use ProviderProtocol
  - IStorageProvider: Persistent volume operations → Use ProviderProtocol
  - IProvider: Combined compute + storage + user management → Use ProviderProtocol
  - IProviderInit: Provider initialization → Use ProviderInitProtocol
  - IRemoteOperations: Remote operations → Use RemoteOperationsProtocol
