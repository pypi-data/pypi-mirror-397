        such damages. In any case, :em AG’s total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the amount paid by
        the Customer for the Software.
        
        ## 5. Termination
        
        This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated by either party. The Customer may terminate this

AAS HTTP Client is a flexible Python library for interacting with Asset Administration Shell (AAS) and submodel repository servers over HTTP. It uses standard Python dictionaries for function inputs and outputs, making it easy to integrate with a variety of workflows. The client implements the most widely used endpoints defined in the [AAS server specification](https://industrialdigitaltwin.io/aas-specifications/IDTA-01002/v3.1.1/specification/interfaces.html), ensuring compatibility with multiple AAS repository server implementations. This allows you to connect to different AAS servers without changing your client code.

> **Note:** Each client instance is designed to communicate with a single AAS server at a time (1-to-1 mapping). To interact with multiple servers, create a separate client instance for each server.

Tested servers include:
- [Eclipse BaSyx .Net SDK server (Fluid4.0 Fork)](https://github.com/fluid40/basyx-dotnet)
- [Eclipse BaSyx Java SDK server](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-java-sdk)
- [Eclipse BaSyx Python SDK server](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-python-sdk)
- [Eclipse AASX server](https://github.com/eclipse-aaspe)

The actual behavior of the client may vary depending on the specific server implementation and its level of compliance with the [AAS specification](https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/content-hub/aasspecifications). Supported endpoints and features depend on what each server provides.

In addition to the core HTTP client, this library offers wrapper modules for popular AAS frameworks. These wrappers use the HTTP client as middleware and expose SDK-specific data model classes for input and output, making integration with those frameworks seamless.

Currently available wrappers:
- [Eclipse BaSyx Python SDK](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-python-sdk)

The AAS HTTP Client package also include some utility functions for for recurring tasks (provided by import 'aas_http_client.utilities'):
- encoder: base64 encoding and decoding
- sdk_tools: e.g. Framework object serialization and deserialization, basic submodel operations
- model_builder: creation of some basic AAS model elements
