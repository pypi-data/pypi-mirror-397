or send us an [e-mail](sherpa@projects.hepforge.org).

To install use the commands
```
cmake -S <sherpadir> -B <builddir> [+ optional configuration options, see cmake -LAH]
cmake --build <builddir> [other build options, e.g. -j 8]
cmake --install <builddir>
```

You can then run test, if you like, with:
```
ctest --test-dir <builddir>
```

If you used the configuration option `-DSHERPA_ENABLE_CATCH2` (and
have Catch2 v3) installed, this will also run unit tests.

Required dependencies are LHAPDF and libzip, they can be automaticall installed by adding
the options
```
-DSHERPA_ENABLE_INSTALL_LHAPDF=ON -DSHERPA_ENABLE_INSTALL_LIBZIP=ON
```
to the first `cmake` command. There are some optional features which can be compiled 
into Sherpa, please read the info page (`info Manual/Sherpa.info`) 
or run `cmake -LAH` to find out more about the available options.

Check out our [Getting started section](Manual/source/manual/getting-started.rst) for additional guidance.
