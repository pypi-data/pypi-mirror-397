    """Universal path base class and factory.

    This class inherits from pathlib.Path and serves dual purposes:
    1. Base class for all path types in the panpath package
    2. Factory for creating appropriate path instances via __new__

    As a base class, it's inherited by:
    - LocalPath (local filesystem paths with sync and async methods)
    - CloudPath (cloud storage paths with sync and async methods)
    - All cloud-specific subclasses (GSPath, S3Path, AzurePath, etc.)

    As a factory, calling PanPath(...) returns the appropriate concrete implementation
    based on the URI scheme.

    Use `isinstance(obj, PanPath)` to check if an object is a path created by this package.

    Examples:
        >>> # Local path
        >>> path = PanPath("/local/file.txt")
        >>> isinstance(path, PanPath)
        True

        >>> # S3 path
        >>> path = PanPath("s3://bucket/key.txt")
        >>> isinstance(path, PanPath)
        True

        >>> # Async method with a_ prefix
        >>> content = await path.a_read_text()
