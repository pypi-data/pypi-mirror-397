# Debugging 

Debugging in vscode offers three debugging modes: "Python API (python)", "Python API (c++)", and "R API".

## Requirements

You need to set up a conda environment with the conda packages specified in the platform specific conda specs in binder/. E.g.:

```txt
    conda env create -f binder/env-osx-arm64.yml
```

If you cannot find you platform try `env-from-history.yml`.

### Linux

- gcc compiler
- gdb debugger

The VScode extensions:

- C/C++
- C/C++ Extensions

### Mac

- XCode command line tool

The VScode extensions:

- C/C++
- C/C++ Extensions
- CodeLLDB

## Debugging

### Python API

Debugging requires that the module compiled and installed in editable mode:

   pip install -e ".[jax]" --force-reinstall

> Tip: if compiling an editable install fails, it is often easier to identifying the problem by compiling/installing with regular `pip install .`. Just remember to uninstall (`pip uninstall phasic`) and do the `pip install -e .` before you continue debugging.

Debugging in vscode offers the debugging modes "Python API (python)" and "Python API (c++)". The Python debugger runs the unit tests in tests/ and then any code in `.vscode/debug.py`.

The C++ debugger runs ...

### R API

Debugging in vscode offers a "R API" debugging mode. You need to have an open R file from tests/ when launching the debugger.

# Conda package

    pixi run bump-version
    pixi run github-release




The default ipc should only store "anonymous" traces without any meta info, but with the option to store metainfo about model parameterization, statespace, orig, graph, etc, making it possible to run inference using cached data alone.

 so that inference can be made without
