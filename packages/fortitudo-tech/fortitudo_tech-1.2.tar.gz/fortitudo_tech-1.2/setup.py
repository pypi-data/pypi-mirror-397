You can do this by following these steps::\n\n   conda create -n fortitudo.tech -c conda-forge python scipy pandas matplotlib cvxopt\n   conda activate fortitudo.tech\n   pip install fortitudo.tech\n\nThe examples might require you to install additional packages, e.g., seaborn and\nipykernel/notebook/jupyterlab if you want to run the notebooks. Using pip to\ninstall these packages should not cause any dependency issues.\n\nYou can also explore the examples in the cloud without any local installations using\n`Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fortitudo-tech/fortitudo.tech/main?labpath=examples>`_.\nHowever, note that Binder servers have very limited resources and might not support\nsome of the optimized routines this package uses. If you want access to a stable\nand optimized environment with persistent storage, please subscribe to our Data\nScience Server.\n\nCompany\n-------\n\nFortitudo Technologies offers novel investment software as well as quantitative\nand digitalization consultancy to the investment management industry. For more\ninformation, please visit our `website <https://fortitudo.tech>`_.\n\nDisclaimer\n----------\n\nThis package is completely separate from our proprietary solutions and therefore\nnot representative of the quality and functionality offered by the Investment Simulation\nand Investment Analysis modules.\n\nFor a short presentation of which CVaR problems the Investment Analysis module can solve\nand at what speed, see the\n`cvar-optimization-benchmarks repository <https://github.com/fortitudo-tech/cvar-optimization-benchmarks>`_.\n\nIf you are an institutional investor and want to experience how these methods\ncan be used for sophisticated analysis in practice, please request a demo by\nsending an email to demo@fortitudo.tech.\n",
