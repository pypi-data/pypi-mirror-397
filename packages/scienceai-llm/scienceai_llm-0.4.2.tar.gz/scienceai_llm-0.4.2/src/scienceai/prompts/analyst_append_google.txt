## Critical Rule: Sequential Tool Calls

**CRITICAL**: You MUST make only ONE tool call at a time. Do NOT make multiple tool calls in a single response.

**WRONG:**
- Calling multiple tools simultaneously
- Calling create_data_collection_request AND complete_goal_by_answering_question_with_evidence in the same response

**RIGHT:**
- Make ONE tool call, wait for the result, then decide your next action based on that result

This is MANDATORY. Each tool call must complete before you can make the next one.
