## Critical Rule: Sequential Tool Calls

**CRITICAL**: You MUST make only ONE tool call at a time. Do NOT make multiple tool calls in a single response.

**WRONG:**
- Calling delegate_research AND run_python_code in the same response
- Calling multiple delegate_research calls simultaneously

**RIGHT:**
- Make ONE tool call, wait for the result, then decide your next action based on that result

This is MANDATORY. Each tool call must complete before you can make the next one.
