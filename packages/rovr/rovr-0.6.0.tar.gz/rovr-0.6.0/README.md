uv run textual console
```
For more info on Textual's console, refer to https://textual.textualize.io/guide/devtools/#console

### FAQ

1. There isn't X theme/Why isn't Y theme available?

- Textual's currently available themes are limited. However, extra themes can be added via the config file in the format below
- You can take a look at what each color represents in https://textual.textualize.io/guide/design/#base-colors<br>Inheriting themes will **not** be added.

```toml
[[custom_theme]]
name = "<str>"
primary = "<hex>"
secondary = "<hex>"
success = "<hex>"
warning = "<hex>"
error = "<hex>"
accent = "<hex>"
foreground = "<hex>"
background = "<hex>"
surface = "<hex>"
panel = "<hex>"
is_dark = "<bool>"
variables = {
  "<key>" = "<value>"
}
```

2. Why is it considered post-modern?

- Parody to my current editor, [helix](https://helix-editor.com)
  - If neovim is considered modern, then helix is post-modern
  - If superfile is considered modern, then rovr is post-modern

3. What can I contribute?

- Themes, and features can be contributed.
- Refactors will be frowned on, and may take a longer time before merging.

4. I want to add a feature/theme/etc! How do I do so?

- You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) at minimum. [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff) are recommended to be installed.
- Clone the repo, and inside it, run `uv sync` and `pre-commit install`.
- Make your changes, ensure that your changes are properly formatted (via the pre-commit hook), before pushing to a **custom** branch on your fork.
- For more info, check the [how to contribute](https://nspc911.github.io/rovr/contributing/how-to-contribute) page.

5. How do I make a feature suggestion?

- Open an issue using the `feature-request` tag, with an estimated difficulty as an optional difficulty level label

6. Why not ratatui or bubbletea??? <sub><i>angry noises</i></sub>

- I like python.
