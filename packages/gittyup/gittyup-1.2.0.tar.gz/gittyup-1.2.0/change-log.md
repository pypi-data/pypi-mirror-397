## [Unreleased]

---

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- `--ignore-all-changes` option to allow updates even with uncommitted changes (modified/staged/untracked files)
  - Performs safety checks to ensure no merge conflicts would occur
  - Fetches from origin and checks if files to be pulled overlap with files that have uncommitted changes
  - Only proceeds with pull if no conflicts detected between uncommitted files and incoming changes
  - More permissive than `--ignore-untracked` which only works with untracked files
  - Mutually exclusive with `--ignore-untracked` flag
- New `async_check_for_merge_conflicts()` function to detect potential conflicts between uncommitted changes and incoming pull
  - Checks all types of uncommitted files (modified, staged, untracked)
  - Provides detailed error messages when conflicts are detected

### Changed
- Updated CLI validation to prevent using both `--ignore-untracked` and `--ignore-all-changes` together
- Enhanced repository update logic to handle different types of uncommitted changes more granularly

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-25

### Added
- `--ignore-untracked` option to allow updates even when untracked files are present (addresses GitHub issue #2)
  - Performs safety checks to ensure untracked files won't be overwritten by pull
  - Fetches from origin and checks for potential conflicts before pulling
  - Distinguishes between untracked files (safe with checks) and modified files (still skipped)
  - Only proceeds with pull if no conflicts detected between untracked files and incoming changes
- Always-ignored files list for common working files that don't block updates (addresses GitHub issue #2)
  - `.DS_Store` (macOS file system metadata)
  - `Thumbs.db` (Windows thumbnail cache)
  - `__pycache__` (Python bytecode cache directories)
  - These files are automatically filtered when determining if a repository has uncommitted changes
  - Repositories with only these files are treated as clean and can be updated

### Changed
- Improved uncommitted files detection to distinguish between untracked vs modified/staged files
- Enhanced skip reason logging to provide more specific information about why repos were skipped
- Modified `get_repo_status()` and `async_get_repo_status()` to filter out always-ignored files
- Updated `has_only_untracked_files()` to automatically exclude always-ignored files from consideration

### Fixed
- Fixed `--explain` recommendation to include directory path when scanning non-current directories
  - Now correctly shows `gittyup /path/to/dir --explain` instead of just `gittyup --explain`
  - Prevents confusion when users scan a different directory than their current working directory

---

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-25

### Fixed
- Fixed AttributeError in CLI by importing RepoInfo and ScanResult from models module instead of scanner module (PR #4)

### Changed
- Updated documentation to reflect PyPI availability at https://pypi.org/project/gittyup/
- Changed primary installation method to `uv tool install gittyup` (from PyPI)
- Updated README.md, INSTALLATION.md, and RELEASE_NOTES.md with PyPI installation instructions
- Added PyPI badges to README.md
- Added pytest-asyncio to development dependencies for async test support
- Added asyncio marker to pytest.ini configuration
- Recompiled development requirements with updated dependencies
- Updated version management to use importlib.metadata for dynamic version resolution

---
