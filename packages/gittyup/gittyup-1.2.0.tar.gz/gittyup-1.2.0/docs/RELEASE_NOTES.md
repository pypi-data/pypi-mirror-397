# 🎉 Gitty Up - Release Notes

---

## 🚀 v1.1.0 - Logging and History Feature

**Release Date**: TBD  
**Status**: Ready for Release ✅

### 🎯 What's New

#### 📊 **Operation Logging and History**

The headline feature of v1.1.0 is comprehensive operation logging with the new `--explain` command. Never wonder what happened during a previous gittyup run again!

**Key Features:**
- **Persistent Logging**: Every operation is automatically logged with detailed information
- **--explain Command**: Review previous operations with rich, detailed output
- **Zero Impact**: Logging happens silently—no changes to normal CLI output
- **Cross-Platform**: OS-specific cache directories (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **Detailed Data**: Captures commits, file changes, errors, timing, and more

### 📝 New Command: `--explain`

View comprehensive history of the last gittyup operation:

```bash
$ cd ~/projects
$ gittyup --explain
```

**What you'll see:**
- Complete operation metadata (date, duration, versions)
- Summary statistics across all repositories
- Detailed per-repository information:
  - Exact commits pulled with authors and timestamps
  - Files changed with insertion/deletion counts
  - Skip reasons for repositories not updated
  - Full error details and diagnostics
  - Branch information and operation timing

### 🗄️ Cache Storage

Logs are stored in OS-specific cache directories:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Caches/gittyup/logs`
- **Linux**: `~/.cache/gittyup/logs`  
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\gittyup\logs`

**Storage Impact**: Minimal (10-50 KB per log entry)

### 🔧 Technical Details

**New Dependencies:**
- `platformdirs>=4.0.0` - Cross-platform cache directory detection
- `diskcache>=5.6.0` - Efficient persistent key-value storage

**New Modules:**
- `logger.py` - LogManager class for cache operations
- Extended `models.py` - FileChange, CommitInfo, RepoLogEntry, OperationLog

**Test Coverage:**
- Added 101 new tests for logging functionality
- Total: 216 tests passing (was 115)
- Coverage: 91.93% (exceeding 90% goal)

### 📚 Documentation Updates

- Complete `--explain` usage documentation
- Cache location guide for all platforms
- Troubleshooting section for logging issues
- 4 new FAQ entries about history and logs
- Updated project statistics

### 🎓 Usage Examples

**Review what changed:**
```bash
$ gittyup ~/projects
# ... updates repositories ...

$ gittyup --explain
# Shows detailed history including:
# - Which commits were pulled
# - What files changed
# - Why repos were skipped
# - Full error details
```

**Perfect for:**
- Debugging failed operations
- Reviewing what commits were pulled
- Understanding why repositories were skipped
- Tracking operation history over time
- Auditing changes across multiple repositories

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

## 🎉 v1.0.0 - Initial Release

**Release Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: Production Ready ✅

---

## 🚀 Overview

We're thrilled to announce the first production release of **Gitty Up** - a powerful CLI tool that automatically discovers and updates all Git repositories in a directory tree. Never forget to pull again!

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 **Intelligent Repository Discovery**
- Recursively scans directories to find all Git repositories
- Smart exclusion of common directories (`node_modules`, `venv`, `build`, etc.)
- Handles symlinks and circular references safely
- Configurable depth limits for large directory trees

### 🎯 **Automated Git Operations**
- Executes `git pull` on all discovered repositories
- Detects and respects repository states (detached HEAD, uncommitted changes)
- Identifies repositories without remotes or upstream branches
- Handles network timeouts and authentication errors gracefully

### 🎨 **Beautiful, Intuitive Output**
- **Color-coded status messages**:
  - 🟢 Green: Successfully updated repositories
  - 🔵 Cyan: Progress indicators and information
  - 🟡 Yellow: Warnings and skipped repositories
  - 🔴 Red: Errors requiring attention
- Real-time progress indicators
- Comprehensive summary statistics
- Customizable verbosity levels (quiet, normal, verbose)

### ⚙️ **Flexible CLI Options**
```bash
gittyup [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]

Options:
  -n, --dry-run            Preview changes without updating
  -d, --max-depth INTEGER  Limit directory traversal depth
  -e, --exclude TEXT       Exclude additional directory patterns
  -v, --verbose            Show detailed output
  -q, --quiet              Show only errors
  --version                Show version
  --help                   Show help message
```

### 🛡️ **Robust Error Handling**
- Non-blocking: One failure doesn't stop the entire process
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Handles edge cases:
  - Permission denied
  - Network failures
  - Merge conflicts
  - Detached HEAD states
  - Uncommitted changes
  - Missing remotes

---

## 📊 Technical Excellence

- **115 comprehensive tests** covering:
  - Unit tests for all modules
  - Integration tests for end-to-end workflows

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Sequential Updates**: Repositories are updated one at a time (faster concurrent mode planned for v1.1)
2. **Pull Only**: Currently only supports `git pull` (status checking and other operations planned)
3. **No Stashing**: Doesn't auto-stash uncommitted changes (planned for v1.2)

### Workarounds
- For faster updates on many repos, run multiple instances in different directories
- Manually resolve uncommitted changes or merge conflicts before running

---

## 🔮 Roadmap (Future Versions)

### v1.1 - Performance & Parallel Operations
- Concurrent repository updates with `--parallel` flag
- Performance optimizations for large directory trees
- Caching for repository discovery

### v1.2 - Advanced Git Features
- Status checking mode (`--status`)
- Auto-stash uncommitted changes option
- Branch specification (`--branch`)
- Fetch-only mode

### v1.3 - Enhanced User Experience
- Interactive mode to select which repos to update
- Desktop notifications on completion
- Configuration file support (`.gittyuprc`)
- Report generation (JSON/CSV export)

### v2.0 - Ecosystem Integration
- GitHub/GitLab integration
- Team collaboration features
- Webhook notifications
- Plugin system for custom hooks
