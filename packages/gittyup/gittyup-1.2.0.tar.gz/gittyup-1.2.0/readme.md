**What --explain shows:**
- **Complete operation metadata**: When it ran, how long it took, tool versions
- **Summary statistics**: Overall results across all repositories  
- **Detailed repository information**:
  - Every commit that was pulled (who wrote it, when, what changed)
  - Exactly which files changed with insertion/deletion counts
  - Why any repos were skipped with specific reasons
  - Full error details for debugging failed operations
  - Branch information and precise timing data

**Perfect for:**
- Debugging issues or understanding unexpected changes
- Auditing what happened during automated runs
- Reviewing what you missed while away from your desk
- Team accountability and change tracking

**Where logs are stored:**
Your guardian keeps records in OS-specific cache directories:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Caches/gittyup/logs`
- **Linux**: `~/.cache/gittyup/logs`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\gittyup\logs`

Each directory you scan gets its own log, automatically updated with each run. Storage is minimal (10-50 KB per log).

## 🛡️ Safety Features

Gitty Up protects your work with intelligent safety checks. It will **skip** updating a repository if it detects:

| Condition | Why it's Skipped | What to Do |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| 🔒 Uncommitted changes | Prevents losing your work | Commit, stash, or discard changes first |
| 🔗 No remote configured | Nothing to pull from | Add a remote: `git remote add origin <url>` |
| 📍 Detached HEAD state | Not on a branch | Checkout a branch: `git checkout main` |
| 🎯 No upstream branch | Branch not tracking remote | Set upstream: `git push -u origin <branch>` |
| 🌐 Network errors | Can't reach remote | Check connection and remote URL |
| 🔐 Authentication failed | Credentials missing | Configure Git credentials |

**Your local work is always safe.** Gitty Up never forces changes or overwrites uncommitted work.

---

## 🧠 Smart Filtering

Gitty Up automatically skips common directories that aren't your code:

**Development Environments:**  
`node_modules`, `venv`, `.venv`, `env`, `.env`, `vendor`

**Build Artifacts:**  
`dist`, `build`, `target`, `.eggs`, `eggs`

**Caches:**  
`__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, `htmlcov`

**Tools:**  
`.tox`, `.nox`, `.idea`, `.vscode`

**Version Control:**  
`.git`, `.svn`, `.hg`

Want to exclude more? Use `--exclude`:
```bash
gittyup --exclude temp --exclude backup --exclude old-stuff
```

### 🧹 Always-Ignored Files

GittyUp knows the difference between real changes and desktop clutter. These common system and cache files are automatically ignored when checking for uncommitted changes:

- **`.DS_Store`** - macOS metadata that clutters every directory
- **`Thumbs.db`** - Windows thumbnail caches you never asked for  
- **`__pycache__`** - Python bytecode that regenerates anyway

**Why this matters:** Repositories with only these files are treated as clean and can be updated automatically. No more "uncommitted changes" blocks just because your OS left metadata files lying around.

**📚 Learn more:** See [Always-Ignored Files Documentation](docs/always-ignored-files.md) for detailed examples and implementation details.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Will Gitty Up overwrite my local changes?</strong></summary>

**Absolutely not.** By default, Gitty Up includes comprehensive safety checks and will skip any repository with uncommitted changes. Your local work is always protected.

If you want more control, use:
- `--ignore-untracked`: Allows updates when only untracked files are present (with safety checks)
- `--ignore-all-changes`: Allows updates even with modified files, but only if no merge conflict would occur
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the difference between --ignore-untracked and --ignore-all-changes?</strong></summary>

- **`--ignore-untracked`**: Only works when you have untracked files (new files not in git). It checks if those files would conflict with incoming changes and only proceeds if safe.
  
- **`--ignore-all-changes`**: Works with any uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files). It performs a more comprehensive safety check—fetches from origin and verifies that none of your uncommitted files would conflict with incoming changes. Only proceeds if the pull can be done safely.

**When to use which:**
- Use `--ignore-untracked` if you often have temporary/working files that aren't tracked
- Use `--ignore-all-changes` if you need to pull updates even when you have work in progress, but want assurance you won't get merge conflicts

Both flags are mutually exclusive—use the one that fits your workflow.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if I have a merge conflict?</strong></summary>

Gitty Up will detect the conflict, report it as an error, and move on to the next repository. You'll need to resolve conflicts manually—Gitty Up never forces merges.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this with private repositories?</strong></summary>

Yes! As long as your Git credentials are properly configured (SSH keys or credential helper), Gitty Up will work seamlessly with private repos.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I exclude specific directories?</strong></summary>

Use the `--exclude` option (multiple times if needed):
```bash
gittyup --exclude archive --exclude temp --exclude old-projects
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it work with Git submodules?</strong></summary>

Gitty Up treats the parent repository as a single unit and doesn't traverse into submodules. This prevents confusion and duplicate updates.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I run this on a schedule?</strong></summary>

Absolutely! Set up a cron job (Unix) or Task Scheduler (Windows):
```bash
# Example: Daily at 9 AM
0 9 * * * cd ~/projects && ~/.local/bin/gittyup --quiet
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if one repository fails?</strong></summary>

Gitty Up continues processing all other repositories. Failures are clearly reported at the end, and you can address them individually.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it support SVN or Mercurial?</strong></summary>

No, Gitty Up is specifically designed for Git repositories. It's Git all the way down. 🐴
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What information does --explain show?</strong></summary>

Think of `--explain` as your guardian's detailed report card. It shows:
- **Every commit that was pulled**: Who wrote it, when they committed it, and the commit message
- **Exactly which files changed**: File paths with insertion/deletion counts
- **Why any repos were skipped**: Specific reasons like uncommitted changes or detached HEAD
- **Full error details**: Complete diagnostics for debugging any issues
- **Operation metadata**: When it ran, how long it took, versions used

Perfect when you need to understand what happened, debug an issue, or provide accountability for automated runs. No need to re-run the operation—your guardian remembers everything.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where are logs stored and how much space do they use?</strong></summary>

Your guardian stores logs in OS-specific cache directories using efficient key-value storage:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Caches/gittyup/logs`
- **Linux**: `~/.cache/gittyup/logs`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\gittyup\logs`

Storage impact is minimal: each log is typically 10-50 KB. Even with 100 directories logged, total storage is only 1-5 MB. Each directory gets one log that's updated with each run, so space doesn't grow unbounded.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do dry runs create logs?</strong></summary>

No, dry runs (`--dry-run`) do not save logs. Your guardian only records actual operations that modify repositories. This keeps your history clean and focused on real changes, not "what if" scenarios.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does concurrent batch processing work?</strong></summary>

By default, Gitty Up updates repositories in batches of 3 simultaneously using async I/O operations. This dramatically improves performance when updating many repositories:

```bash
# Default: 3 repos at a time
gittyup ~/projects

# High performance: 5 repos at a time
gittyup ~/projects --batch-size 5

# Sequential (old behavior): 1 repo at a time
gittyup ~/projects --sync
```

**Benefits:**
- **Faster updates**: Network I/O happens concurrently while waiting for git operations
- **Controlled resources**: Batch size prevents overwhelming your system
- **Clear output**: Results are displayed in order after each batch completes

**When to adjust batch size:**
- **Increase** (`--batch-size 5-10`): Fast internet, powerful system, many repos
- **Decrease** (`--batch-size 1` or `--sync`): Debugging issues, slow connection, conservative approach

The concurrent processing is safe and respects all the same safety checks as sequential mode.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Git Not Found
```
Error: Git is not installed or not found in PATH
```
**Fix:** Install Git and ensure it's in your system PATH:
```bash
# macOS
brew install git

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)  
sudo apt-get install git

# Verify
git --version
```

### Authentication Issues
```
Error: Authentication failed
```
**Fix:** Configure your Git credentials:
```bash
# SSH keys (recommended)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
# Then add to GitHub/GitLab/etc.

# Or use credential helper
git config --global credential.helper store
```

### Permission Denied
```
Error: Permission denied
```
**Fix:** Ensure you have read access to the directories being scanned. Check file permissions or run with appropriate privileges.

### Network Timeouts
```
Error: Network error
```
**Fix:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify remote URLs: `git remote -v`
- Check firewall settings
- Consider using `--max-depth` to reduce scope

### Log History Not Found
```
⚠️  No history found for: /path/to/directory
```
**Fix:**
- Run `gittyup` in this directory first (your guardian needs something to record!)
- Remember: logs are only created for actual operations (non-dry-run)
- Verify you're in the same directory where you previously ran gittyup
- Check that the cache directory has write permissions

### Cache Permission Errors
```
Error: Failed to save operation log
```
**Fix:**
- Ensure write access to cache directory:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Caches/gittyup/logs`
  - Linux: `~/.cache/gittyup/logs`
  - Windows: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\gittyup\logs`
- Check directory permissions: `ls -la ~/.cache/gittyup` (Unix/macOS)
- Create directory manually if needed: `mkdir -p ~/.cache/gittyup/logs`
