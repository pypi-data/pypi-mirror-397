## Typing stubs for google-cloud-ndb

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`google-cloud-ndb`](https://github.com/googleapis/python-ndb) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `google-cloud-ndb`. This version of
`types-google-cloud-ndb` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`google-cloud-ndb==2.4.*`.

This stub package is marked as [partial](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/google-cloud-ndb`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/google-cloud-ndb)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.18.2
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.407

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`8d96801533918957fb194e101cb321bfe1f836f8`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/8d96801533918957fb194e101cb321bfe1f836f8).
