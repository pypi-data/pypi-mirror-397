## Example Applications
Check out the [examples](./examples/) folder for some example applications.

## Documentation
See [https://docs.neuphonic.com](https://docs.neuphonic.com) for the complete API documentation.

## Installation
Install this package into your environment using your chosen package manager:

```bash
pip install pyneuphonic
```

In most cases, you will be playing the audio returned from our servers directly on your device.
We offer utilities to play audio through your device's speakers using `pyaudio`.
To use these utilities, please also `pip install pyaudio`.

> :warning: Mac users encountering a `'portaudio.h' file not found` error can resolve it by running
> `brew install portaudio`.

### API Key
Get your API key from the [Neuphonic website](https://beta.neuphonic.com) and set it in your
environment, for example:
```bash
export NEUPHONIC_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY HERE>
```

## Speech Generation

### Configure the Text-to-Speech Synthesis
To configure the TTS settings, modify the TTSConfig model.
The following parameters are examples of parameters which can be adjusted. Ensure that the selected combination of model, language, and voice is valid. For details on supported combinations, refer to the [Models](https://docs.neuphonic.com/resources/models) and [Voices](https://docs.neuphonic.com/resources/voices) pages.

- **`lang_code`**
  Language code for the desired language.

  **Default**: `'en'` **Examples**: `'en'`, `'es'`, `'de'`, `'nl'`

- **`voice`**
  The voice ID for the desired voice. Ensure this voice ID is available for the selected model and language.

  **Default**: `None` **Examples**: `'8e9c4bc8-3979-48ab-8626-df53befc2090'`

- **`speed`**
  Playback speed of the audio.

  **Default**: `1.0`
  **Examples**: `0.7`, `1.0`, `1.5`

View the [TTSConfig](https://github.com/neuphonic/pyneuphonic/blob/main/pyneuphonic/models.py) object to see all valid options.

### SSE (Server Side Events)
```python
from pyneuphonic import Neuphonic, TTSConfig
from pyneuphonic.player import AudioPlayer
import os

client = Neuphonic(api_key=os.environ.get('NEUPHONIC_API_KEY'))

sse = client.tts.SSEClient()

# View the TTSConfig object to see all valid options
tts_config = TTSConfig(
    speed=1.05,
    lang_code='en',
    voice_id='e564ba7e-aa8d-46a2-96a8-8dffedade48f'  # use client.voices.list() to view all voice ids
)

# Create an audio player with `pyaudio`
with AudioPlayer() as player:
    response = sse.send('Hello, world!', tts_config=tts_config)
    player.play(response)

    player.save_audio('output.wav')  # save the audio to a .wav file from the player
```

### Asynchronous SSE
```python
from pyneuphonic import Neuphonic, TTSConfig
from pyneuphonic.player import AsyncAudioPlayer
import os
import asyncio

async def main():
    client = Neuphonic(api_key=os.environ.get('NEUPHONIC_API_KEY'))

    sse = client.tts.AsyncSSEClient()

    # Set the desired configurations: playback speed and voice
    tts_config = TTSConfig(speed=1.05, lang_code='en', voice_id=None)

    async with AsyncAudioPlayer() as player:
        response = sse.send('Hello, world!', tts_config=tts_config)
        await player.play(response)

        player.save_audio('output.wav')  # save the audio to a .wav file

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Asynchronous Websocket
```python
from pyneuphonic import Neuphonic, TTSConfig, WebsocketEvents
from pyneuphonic.models import APIResponse, TTSResponse
from pyneuphonic.player import AsyncAudioPlayer
import os
import asyncio

async def main():
    client = Neuphonic(api_key=os.environ.get('NEUPHONIC_API_KEY'))

    ws = client.tts.AsyncWebsocketClient()

    # Set the desired voice
    tts_config = TTSConfig(voice_id=None) # will default to the default voice_id, please refer to the Neuphonic Docs

    player = AsyncAudioPlayer()
    await player.open()

    # Attach event handlers. Check WebsocketEvents enum for all valid events.
    async def on_message(message: APIResponse[TTSResponse]):
        await player.play(message.data.audio)

    async def on_close():
        await player.close()

    ws.on(WebsocketEvents.MESSAGE, on_message)
    ws.on(WebsocketEvents.CLOSE, on_close)

    await ws.open(tts_config=tts_config)

    # A special symbol ' <STOP>' must be sent to the server, otherwise the server will wait for
    # more text to be sent before generating the last few snippets of audio
    await ws.send('Hello, world!', autocomplete=True)
    await ws.send('Hello, world! <STOP>')  # Both the above line, and this line, are equivalent

    await asyncio.sleep(3)  # let the audio play
    player.save_audio('output.wav')  # save the audio to a .wav file
    await ws.close()  # close the websocket and terminate the audio resources

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Saving Audio
To save the audio to a file, you can use the `save_audio` function from the `pyneuphonic` package to save the audio from responses from the synchronous SSE client.

```python
from pyneuphonic import save_audio

...
response = sse.send('Hello, world!', tts_config=tts_config)

save_audio(response, 'output.wav')
```

The `save_audio` function takes in two arguments: the response from the TTS service (as well as audio bytes) and the file path to save the audio to.

For async responses, you can use the `async_save_audio` function.

```python
from pyneuphonic.player import async_save_audio

...

response = sse.send('Hello, world!', tts_config=tts_config)

await async_save_audio(response, 'output.wav')
```

## Voices
### Get Voices
To get all available voices you can run the following snippet.
```python
from pyneuphonic import Neuphonic
import os

client = Neuphonic(api_key=os.environ.get('NEUPHONIC_API_KEY'))
response = client.voices.list()  # get's all available voices
voices = response.data['voices']

voices
```

### Get Voice
To get information about an existing voice please call.
```python
response = client.voices.get(voice_id='<VOICE_ID>')  # gets information about the selected voice id
response.data  # response contains all information about this voice
```


### Clone Voice

To clone a voice based on a audio file, you can run the following snippet.

```python
from pyneuphonic import Neuphonic
import os

client = Neuphonic(api_key=os.environ.get('NEUPHONIC_API_KEY'))

response = client.voices.clone(
    voice_name='<VOICE_NAME>',
    voice_tags=['tag1', 'tag2'],  # optional, add descriptive tags of what your voice sounds like
    voice_file_path='<FILE_PATH>.wav'  # replace with file path to a sample of the voice to clone
)

response.data  # this will contain a success message with the voice_id of the cloned voice
```

If you have successfully cloned a voice, the following message will be displayed: "Voice has
successfully been cloned with ID `<VOICE_ID>`." Once cloned, you can use this voice just like any of
the standard voices when calling the TTS (Text-to-Speech) service.

To see a list of all available voices, including cloned ones, use `client.voices.list()`.

**Note:** Your voice reference clip must meet the following criteria: it should be at least 6
seconds long, in .mp3 or .wav format, and no larger than 10 MB in size.

### Update Voice

You can update any of the attributes of a voice: name, tags and the reference audio file the voice
was cloned on.
You can select which voice to update using either it's `voice_id` or it's name.

```python
# Updating using the original voice's name
response = client.voices.update(
    voice_name='<ORIGINAL_VOICE_NAME>',  # this is the name of voice we want to update

    # Provide any, or all of the following, to update the voice
    new_voice_name='<NEW_VOICE_NAME>',
    new_voice_tags=['new_tag_1', 'new_tag_2'],  # overwrite all previous tags
    new_voice_file_path='<NEW_FILE_PATH>.wav',
)

response.data
```

```python
# Updating using the original voice's `voice_id`
response = client.voices.update(
    voice_id ='<VOICE_ID>',  # this is the id of voice we want to update

    # Provide any, or all of the following, to update the voice
    new_voice_name='<NEW_VOICE_NAME>',
    new_voice_tags=['new_tag_1', 'new_tag_2'],  # overwrite all previous tags
    new_voice_file_path='<NEW_FILE_PATH>.wav',
)

response.data
```

**Note:** Your voice reference clip must meet the following criteria: it should be at least 6 seconds long, in .mp3 or .wav format, and no larger than 10 MB in size.

### Delete Voice
To delete a cloned voice:

```python
# Delete using the voice's name
response = client.voices.delete(voice_name='<VOICE_NAME>')
response.data
```
```python
# Delete using the voices `voice_id`
response = client.voices.delete(voice_id='<VOICE_ID>')
response.data
```


## Agents
With Agents, you can create, manage, and interact with intelligent AI assistants. You can create an
agent easily using the example here:
```python
import os
import asyncio

# View the AgentConfig object for a full list of parameters to configure the agent
from pyneuphonic import Neuphonic, Agent, AgentConfig


async def main():
    client = Neuphonic(api_key=os.environ.get('NEUPHONIC_API_KEY'))

    agent_id = client.agents.create(
        name='Agent 1',
        prompt='You are a helpful agent. Answer in 10 words or less.',
        greeting='Hi, how can I help you today?'
    ).data['agent_id']

    # All additional keyword arguments (such as `agent_id`) are passed as
    # parameters to the model. See AgentConfig model for full list of parameters.
    agent = Agent(client, agent_id=agent_id)

    try:
        await agent.start()

        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        await agent.stop()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Connecting MCP Servers
Connect your custom MCP servers to enhance your agent with unlimited capabilities.

You can connect MCP servers to your Agent to provide it with any functionality you need. The Agent will automatically utilize these tools throughout the conversation as appropriate. For an introduction to MCP, refer to the [official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

```python
client = Neuphonic(api_key=os.environ.get('NEUPHONIC_API_KEY'))

agent = Agent(
    client,
    agent_id='<AGENT_ID>',
    mcp_servers=['https://1234-56-789-123-4.ngrok-free.app/sse']
)
```

### List agents
To list all your agents:
```python
response = client.agents.list()
response.data
```

### Get agent
To get information about a specific agent:
```python
response = client.agents.get(agent_id='<AGENT_ID>')
response.data
```

### Multilingual Agents
Neuphonic agents support multiple languages, allowing you to create conversational AI in your preferred language:

- **Available Languages**: For a comprehensive list of supported languages, visit our [Official Documentation - Languages](https://docs.neuphonic.com/resources/languages)
- **Example Implementation**: Check out the [Spanish agent example](./examples/agents/multilingual_agent.py) to see multilingual capabilities in action

Creating a multilingual agent is as simple as specifying the `lang_code` and appropriate `voice_id` when instantiating your `Agent`.

### Interruption handling
The `Agent` class supports interruption handling, which allows users to interrupt the agent while
it's speaking.

By default, the system intelligently enables interruptions when using devices that won't create audio
feedback (like headphones or earphones), and disables them for speakers that might cause echo.

This behavior is automatically determined based on your default audio output device, but you can
explicitly control it when instantiating the `Agent` class:
```python
agent = Agent(client, agent_id=agent_id, allow_interruptions=True)
```
