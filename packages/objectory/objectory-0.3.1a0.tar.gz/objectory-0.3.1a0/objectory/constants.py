r"""Define some constants used in the package.

These constants can be used outside the package to be robust to
naming change.

Example usage:

```pycon

>>> from objectory import factory, OBJECT_TARGET
>>> config = {OBJECT_TARGET: "collections.Counter", "a": 4, "b": 2}
>>> obj = factory(**config)
>>> obj
Counter({'a': 4, 'b': 2})
