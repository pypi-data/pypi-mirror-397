"""Itential Automation Gateway client implementation for the SDK.

This module provides client implementations for connecting to and interacting
with Itential Automation Gateway 4.x. It includes both synchronous and
asynchronous clients with basic username/password authentication.

Components
----------
The module exports the following components:

gateway_factory:
    Factory function that creates and configures Gateway or AsyncGateway
    instances based on the want_async parameter. This is the primary
    entry point for creating Gateway connections.

Gateway:
    Synchronous client for Itential Automation Gateway. Dynamically created
    by combining AuthMixin with Connection base class. Supports all standard
    HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) with automatic authentication.

AsyncGateway:
    Asynchronous client for Itential Automation Gateway. Dynamically created
    by combining AsyncAuthMixin with AsyncConnection base class. Provides
    async/await support for non-blocking API requests.

AuthMixin:
    Synchronous authentication mixin that implements basic username/password
    authentication for Gateway. Automatically authenticates on first request
    and handles authentication errors.

AsyncAuthMixin:
    Asynchronous authentication mixin that implements basic username/password
    authentication for Gateway with async/await support.

Authentication
--------------
Itential Automation Gateway uses basic authentication with username and password
credentials. The authentication flow works as follows:

1. Client is created with username and password via gateway_factory()
2. On first API request, authenticate() is called automatically
3. Credentials are sent to /login endpoint as JSON body
4. Authentication session is maintained for subsequent requests
5. Authentication errors are raised as HTTPStatusError or RequestError

Base URL
--------
The Gateway client automatically prepends "/api/v2.0" to all requests, so you
only need to provide the resource path when making API calls.

For example::

    gateway.get("/devices")  # Actual URL: https://host/api/v2.0/devices

Supported HTTP Methods
----------------------
All Gateway clients support the following HTTP methods:

- GET: Retrieve resources
- POST: Create resources or submit data
- PUT: Update/replace resources
- PATCH: Partially update resources
- DELETE: Delete resources

Error Handling
--------------
All Gateway operations may raise the following exceptions:

- RequestError: Network/connection errors (timeouts, connection refused,
  DNS failures)
- HTTPStatusError: HTTP error responses (401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found,
  500 Internal Server Error, etc.)
- IpsdkError: General SDK errors (invalid parameters, missing credentials)

Examples
--------
Basic synchronous usage::

    from ipsdk import gateway_factory

    # Create Gateway client with default settings
    gateway = gateway_factory(
        host="gateway.example.com",
        user="admin@itential",
        password="password"
    )

    # Get all devices
    response = gateway.get("/devices")
    devices = response.json()

    # Get specific device
    response = gateway.get("/devices/device123")
    device = response.json()

    # Create a new resource
    response = gateway.post("/workflows", json={"name": "my-workflow"})
    workflow = response.json()

Asynchronous usage::

    from ipsdk import gateway_factory

    # Create async Gateway client
    gateway = gateway_factory(
        host="gateway.example.com",
        user="admin@itential",
        password="password",
        want_async=True
    )

    # Use async/await for requests
    async def get_devices():
        response = await gateway.get("/devices")
        return response.json()

Custom configuration::

    from ipsdk import gateway_factory

    # Create Gateway with custom settings
    gateway = gateway_factory(
        host="gateway.example.com",
        port=8443,
        use_tls=True,
        verify=True,
        user="admin@itential",
        password="password",
        timeout=60
    )

Error handling::

    from ipsdk import gateway_factory
    from ipsdk.exceptions import HTTPStatusError, RequestError

    gateway = gateway_factory(host="gateway.example.com")

    try:
        response = gateway.get("/devices")
        devices = response.json()
    except HTTPStatusError as e:
        print(f"HTTP error {e.response.status_code}: {e}")
    except RequestError as e:
        print(f"Network error: {e}")
