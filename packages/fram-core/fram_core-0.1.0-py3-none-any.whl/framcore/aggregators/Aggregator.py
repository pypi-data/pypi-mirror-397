class Aggregator(Base, ABC):
    """
    Aggregator interface class.

    Aggregators handles aggregation and disaggregation of Components.
    - The general approach for aggregation is to group Components, aggregate Components in the same group to (a) new Component(s),
    delete the detailed Components, and add the mapping to self._aggregation_map.
    - The general approach for disaggregation is to restore the detailed Components, move results from aggregated
    Components to detailed Components, and delete the aggregated Components.

    Concrete Aggregators must implement the abstract methods _aggregate() and _disaggregate().

    Some rules for using Aggregators:
    1. Disaggragate can only be called after aggregate has been called.
    2. Not allowed to call aggregate twice. Must call disaggregate before aggregate can be called again.
    3. Aggregators are stored in Model when aggregate is called. Disaggregate by calling Model.disaggregate(),
         which will disaggregate all Aggregators in LIFO order.
    4. At the moment we allow changes to the aggregated Components, which is ignored during disaggregation. TODO: Handle this
    5. It is recommended to only use the same Aggregator type once on the same components of a Model.
        If you want to go from one aggregation level to another, it is better to use Model.disaggregate first and then aggregate again.
        This is to keep the logic simple and avoid complex expressions.

    Some design notes:
    - Levels and profiles are aggregated separately and then combined into attributes.
    - We have chosen to eagerly evaluate weights for aggregation (weighted averages) and disaggregation of levels and profiles.
        This approach supports any form of aggregation by varying the weights, and complex weights can be created by eagerly evaluating
        expressions and using the result to compute those weights.
    - This is a balance between eagerly evaluating everything and setting up complex expressions.
        Eagerly evaluating everything would require setting up new TimeVectors after evaluation, which is not ideal.
        While setting up complex expressions gives expressions that are harder to work with and slower to query from.
    - This trade-off simplifies adding logic that recognises if result expressions come from aggregations or disaggregations.
        When aggregating or disaggregating these, we can go back to the original results rather than setting up complex expressions
        that for examples aggregates the disaggregated results.
