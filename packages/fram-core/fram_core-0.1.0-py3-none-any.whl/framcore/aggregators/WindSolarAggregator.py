    2. Aggregate grouped components into a single aggregated component for each group (self._aggregate_groups):
        - Max_capacity is calculated as the sum of the maximum capacity levels with weighted profiles.
        - Variable operational costs (voc) are aggregated using weighted averages based on the weighting method (now only max_capacity supported).
        - TODO: Add support for additional weighting methods (e.g. production instead of capacity).
        - Production is aggregated as the sum of production levels with weighted profiles. TODO: Add possibility to skip results aggregation.
    2a. Make new hydro module and delete original components from model data.
    3. Add mapping from detailed to aggregated components to self._aggregation_map.


    Disaggregation steps (self._disaggregate):

    1. Restore original components from self._original_data. NB! Changes to aggregated modules are lost except for results (TODO)
    2. Distribute production from aggregated components back to the original components:
        - Results are weighted based on the weighting method (now only max_capacity supported).
