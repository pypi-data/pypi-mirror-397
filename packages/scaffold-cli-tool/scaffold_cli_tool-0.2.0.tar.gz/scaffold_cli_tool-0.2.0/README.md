🚀 Scaffold

A powerful, simple, and beautiful command-line tool to scaffold new Python projects in seconds. Stop wasting time on boilerplate and start building.

Why Scaffold?

Starting a new Python project often means repeating the same tedious steps. Scaffold automates all of that for you with a single command, giving you a clean, modern, and production-ready project structure with a delightful user experience.

✨ Installation
Install Scaffold with a single command using pip:

pip install scaffold-cli
🚀 Quick Start

Scaffold 

supports multiple templates out of the box. Choose the one that fits your needs.

Basic Python Project

The default template is perfect for simple scripts or libraries.

scaffold create my-awesome-app

Watch it happen!

The tool provides beautiful, real-time feedback as it creates your project structure.

🚀 Creating project 'my-web-app' with template 'fastapi'...
Creating project directory: ... done.
Creating source directory: ... done.
Creating file: pyproject.toml ... done.
...

✨ Project created successfully! ✨

* src layout: Prevents many common packaging issues.

* pyproject.toml: The modern standard for defining Python projects.

* .gitignore: Pre-configured to ignore common Python junk.
  
* Beautiful CLI: A colorful, informative interface that makes project creation a joy.

🗺️ Roadmap

Scaffold is just getting started. Here's what we're planning next:

* CLI-Tool Template: A template for building other command-line tools.

* Automatic Git Initialization: Automatically run git init and make an initial commit.

*  Advanced Customization: Add options for license choice, dependency management (Poetry/Pip-tools), and more.

*  Plugin System: Allow users to create and share their own custom templates.
