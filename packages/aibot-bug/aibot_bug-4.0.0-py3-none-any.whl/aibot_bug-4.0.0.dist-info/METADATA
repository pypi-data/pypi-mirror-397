# 🤖 AIbot-bug: Beast Mode 4.0 - Ultimate AI Bug Bounty Orchestrator

AIbot-bug is a professional-grade reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery framework. It merges the raw power of industry-standard security tools with a sophisticated, multi-provider AI brain capable of rotating through 117+ models for autonomous analysis, validation, and exploit generation.

## 🌟 Core Pillars

### 🧠 Multi-AI Cognitive Engine
*   **13+ Providers:** Integrated support for Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, xAI, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, HuggingFace, Qwen, and more.
*   **9 Models Per Provider:** Access to 117+ specialized models for speed, context, or reasoning.
*   **Auto-Rotation:** Intelligent self-healing that switches providers upon rate-limit (429) or quota detection.

### 🤖 Robotic Automation Lab (Beast 4.0)
*   **20 Advanced Robotic Modules:** Including 403 Bypassers, JS Parameter Miners, Broken Link Checkers, and CVE Searchers.
*   **Intelligent Simulation:** Uses AI heuristics to simulate tool logic for high-fidelity discovery.

### ✅ Strong Validation & Anti-FP
*   **Robotic Deduplication:** Hash-based filtering to ensure unique results across all tools.
*   **AI False Positive Check:** Automatic verification of findings to reduce noise and highlight valid vulnerabilities.

### 📊 Clean UI & Structured Logging
*   **Itemized Menu (1-31):** A professional, numbered interface for all core and advanced features.
*   **Strict Stream Separation:** Console output is limited to clean INFO/Monitoring logs, while errors/warnings are captured in `automation.log`.
