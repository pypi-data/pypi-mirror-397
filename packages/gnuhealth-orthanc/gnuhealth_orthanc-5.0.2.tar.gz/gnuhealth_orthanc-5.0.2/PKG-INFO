GNU Health Orthanc PACS server integration package
##################################################

This module provides functions for management of medical image data stored on an Orthanc server.

Description
-----------
The document explains how to integrate the DICOM server Orthanc into the hospital information system GNU Health. 
Here is a video showing the new module look like for the end user in the tryton SAO web client: [#f4]_


Installation
------------

1. You need a working GNU Health HIS 5.x server and an Orthanc server. Follow the instructions at [#f1]_ to install 
and setup the GNU Health server on your test system. In the following, we assume that you have followed the instructions
on the website and that your GNU Health server is located in the directory ``/opt/gnuhealth/his``.

2. Activate the modules for the demo database:
   ::
     
     
      trytond-admin -d <db_name> -u health_orthanc --activate-dependencies


3. Install the local Orthanc server and plugins:
   ::


    sudo apt install orthanc

    sudo apt install orthanc-dicomweb

    sudo apt install orthanc-webviewer

    sudo apt install orthanc-wsi


   Download the OHIF viewer ``libOrthancOHIF.so`` in https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/downloads/linux-standard-base/orthanc-ohif/1.2/index.html and copy it in the plugins directory ``/usr/share/orthanc/plugins/``.

   Download the stone web viewer ``libStoneWebViewer.so`` in https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/downloads/linux-standard-base/stone-web-viewer/2.5/index.html and copy it in the plugins directory ``/usr/share/orthanc/plugins/``.

5. We have created a new widget that allows to select and upload multiple DICOM files in the desktop client and web client. The widget is part of the native GNU Health GTK client

    - For the SAO web client: Let's assume you have installed the SAO client in ``/home/gnuhealth/sao`` (see [#f3]_). If there is not already a custom.js file in the web client's directory, you can just copy the widget into the client:
      ::


        cp custom.js /home/gnuhealth/sao


    Otherwise, you have to manually add the content of our custom.js file to the existing file in the SAO client.    

6.  If you are using nginx as proxy:
   
   In file ``/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/GH_HIS_HTTP.conf`` add the following line in the server block.
   ::
      
      
      client_max_body_size 500M;

      proxy_send_timeout 300;

        
   Restart nginx (debian, ubuntu,...):
   ::
   
   
      systemctl restart nginx
   
    .. note:: If you are using ansible to install gnuhealth as described in https://docs.gnuhealth.org/ansible/examples/gnuhealth_server_and_client.html. You have to modify the ansible files to make the above changes permanent.

7. Restart your GNU Health server.

8. Connect to the demo database with the client and open the module ``Configuration/Imaging Orthanc/Orthanc``. Select ``Add Orthanc Server`` to configure the connection to the Orthanc server.

9. Watch the video [#f4]_ to see how to use the ``Health Imaging Orthanc`` module to fetch DICOM studies from the Orthanc server and open medical images.



.. _Imaging Orthanc:

Orthanc Server Configuration
==============================

The primary function is to establish the connection between Orthanc's DICOM servers and GNU Health. The label of a server is a name that the user can choose to represent the server directly. The domain field contains the full web address (URL) to the Orthanc server. This helps GNU Health to find the correct server to connect to. The user must also provide a username and password to log in to the Orthanc server. 


Configuration
-------------

.. class:: health_orthanc_configuration.ServerConfig(ModelSQL, ModelView)
    
    This class, `ServerConfig`, is used to connect to an Orthanc DICOM server and to check if a connection to the corresponding domain can be established.

    :param ModelView: Inherit from the Tryton ModelView class for user interface operations.
    :type ModelView: class: ``trytond.model.ModelView``

    Here's a brief description of each method:

    - ``__setup__(cls)``: Set up the class for database access by initializing properties and contstrains, such as ensuring the uniqueness 
        of the ``label`` and ``domain`` fields.

    - ``quick_check(domain, user, password)``: Checks if the server details are correct by attempting to connect to the Orthanc DICOM server with the provided domain.

    - ``on_change_with_validated(self)``: Updates the validated field based on the current server details by calling the ``quick_check`` method with the ``domain``, ``user``, and ``password`` attributes.

Imaging Orthanc
===============

This section presents the core aspect of the Orthanc integration. It is designed for uploading and updating patient images and for viewing the images using special Orthanc DICOM viewers.


Data Models for image data
--------------------------

In this module we have developed three data models to organise image study data according to the DICOM format. These models represent studies, series within studies (such as CT, MR or PET scans) and the individual instances within each series. They represent the relationships between these elements. For example, a single patient may undergo multiple studies, each study may consist of multiple series, and each series may contain multiple instances.
