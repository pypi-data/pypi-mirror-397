    These parameters control how synthetic data is generated after the model is trained.

        num_records: Number of synthetic records to generate. Maximum is 130,000 records.
        temperature: Sampling temperature for controlling randomness (higher = more random).
        repetition_penalty: Penalty for token repetition (≥1.0, higher = less repetition).
