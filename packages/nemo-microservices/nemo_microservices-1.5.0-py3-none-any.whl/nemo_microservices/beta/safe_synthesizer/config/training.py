class TrainingHyperparams(Parameters):
    """Hyperparameters that control the training process behavior.

    This class contains all the fine-tuning hyperparameters that control how the model
    learns, including learning rates, batch sizes, LoRA configuration, and optimization
    settings. These parameters directly affect training performance and quality.

    Attributes:
        num_input_records_to_sample: Number of records the model will see during training.
            This parameter is a proxy for training time. For example, if its value is the same
            size as the input dataset, this is like training for a single epoch. If its value
            is larger, this is like training for multiple (possibly fractional) epochs. If its
            value is smaller, this is like training for a fraction of an epoch. Supports 'auto'
            where a reasonable value is chosen based on other config params and data.
        batch_size: The batch size per device for training.
        gradient_accumulation_steps: Number of update steps to accumulate the gradients for,
            before performing a backward/update pass. This technique increases the effective
            batch size that will fit into GPU memory.
        weight_decay: The weight decay to apply (if not zero) to all layers except all
            bias and LayerNorm weights in the AdamW optimizer.
        warmup_ratio: Ratio of total training steps used for a linear warmup from 0
            to the learning rate.
        lr_scheduler: The scheduler type to use. See the HuggingFace documentation of
            `SchedulerType` for all possible values.
        learning_rate: The initial learning rate for `AdamW` optimizer.
        lora_r: The rank of the LoRA update matrices, expressed in int. Lower
            rank results in smaller update matrices with fewer trainable parameters.
        lora_alpha_over_r: The ratio of the LoRA scaling factor (alpha) to
            the LoRA rank. Empirically, this parameter works well when set to 0.5, 1, or 2.
        lora_target_modules: The list of transformer modules to apply LoRA to.
            Possible modules: 'q_proj', 'k_proj', 'v_proj', 'o_proj', 'gate_proj', 'up_proj', 'down_proj'
        use_unsloth: Whether to use unsloth.
        rope_scaling_factor: Scale the base LLM's context length by this factor using RoPE scaling.
        validation_ratio: The fraction of the training data that will be used for validation.
            The range should be 0 to 1. If set to 0, no validation will be performed.
            If set larger than 0, validation loss will be computed and reported throughout training.
        validation_steps: The number of steps between validation checks for the HF Trainer arguments.
        pretrained_model: Pretrained model to use for fine-tuning. Uses default of TinyLlama.
        quantize_model: Whether to quantize the model during training. This can reduce memory usage
            and potentially speed up training, but may also impact model accuracy.
        quantization_bits: The number of bits to use for quantization if `quantize_model` is True.
            Common values are 8 or 4 bits.
        peft_implementation: The PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) implementation to use.
            Options include 'lora' for Low-Rank Adaptation, QLoRA for Quantized LoRA. Each method has its own trade-offs in terms of performance
            and resource requirements.
