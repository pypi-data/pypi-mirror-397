This package includes Python tools and Bash shell scripts for preparation,
running and analyses of soft matter simulations.

### [**Shapespyer documentation with examples and tutorials**](https://simnavi.gitlab.io/shapespyer.io/)

Key functionality:
==================
* Main toolkit: Python package for generation of ordered molecular aggregates 
  and pre-assembled composite structures to seed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
  aimed at studying equilibration (relaxation) processes in soft matter and
  biomolecular systems.

* Bash scripts for automated workflows for preparation and running simulations 
  using *Gromacs, NAMD, DL_POLY or DL_MESO MD* engines (MC via DL_MONTE to be added).

* Scripts (Python and Bash) for semi-automated analyses of cluster formation 
  and evolution, including cluster number and size distributions, but also 
  radii of gyration and principal moments of inertia.

* Parsing SMILES strings (from 'smiles.sml') and generating 3D chemical structures

From the outset, the Shapespyer project has been kindly supported by 
[the Ada Lovelace Centre](https://adalovelacecentre.ac.uk/) 
for expertise in scientific software, research software engineering and data management.

Project description
===================
Started in April 2020, the Shapespyer project is a thriving collaboration between SCD, ISIS 
and Diamond, funded by and developed under the umbrella of the Ada Lovelace Centre (ALC), 
aiming to support and facilitate interdisciplinary research by bridging between theoretical 
analysis, computer simulation and experimental studies. 

The primary goal of the project is to equip Small Angle Scattering (SAS) experimentalists 
at ISIS and Diamond facilities in RAL with a set of simulation and analytical protocols 
allowing for the verification of hypotheses and theoretical models of complex molecular 
nanoaggregates via direct correlation of SAS experiments to detailed computer simulations.

In turn, it is anticipated that this would facilitate the automation of common, routine, 
tasks associated with the creation, simulation and analysis of complex multicomponent 
aggregates, which would both simplify and standardise the use of simulations in analyses 
of SAS experiments. With this in mind, the Shapespyer software package has been 
developed as an experimentalist-oriented Python framework providing a straightforward 
workflow to facilitate the analysis of self-assembled nanostructures, ubiquitous in 
soft condensed matter, and specifically those with biomolecular applications.

Background
==========
In the domain of functional soft matter and biomolecular simulation, the task of preparing 
complex molecular structures of interest is both challenging and tedious. The naive approach 
using an initial configuration with randomised positions of solute molecules is most often 
fruitless due to the complexity of the (unknown) pathways that lead to self-assembly of any 
particular shape of a molecular aggregate. Unfortunately, pre-equilibration into and further 
relaxation of a specific molecular complex can easily require simulation times way beyond what 
is reachable in a practical simulation scenario. Therefore, it is vital to have efficient tools 
facilitating the generation and initial equilibration of pre-assembled molecular complexes with 
predetermined composition and structure. 

Concept
=======
Taking a number of sample (template) molecules as inputs, automatically generate a predefined 
larger, possibly multicomponent, structure that could be used as input for molecular dynamics (MD) 
or Monte Carlo (MC) simulations carried out on virtually any computing platform. The results from 
these calculations include equilibrated structures and trajectories that can be analysed and 
compared with results from small angle scattering (SAS) experiments.​
