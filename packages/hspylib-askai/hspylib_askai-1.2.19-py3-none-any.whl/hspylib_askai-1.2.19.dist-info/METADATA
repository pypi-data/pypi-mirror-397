Born from the idea of empowering individuals with disabilities to navigate the digital world effortlessly, AskAI stands as a beacon of accessibility in the realm of computing. It emerges as a revolutionary solution, harnessing the prowess of AI to bridge the gap between users and the terminal interface. With its intuitive design, AskAI welcomes users of all abilities, eliminating the need for extensive familiarity with shells like bash or zsh. Now, individuals with disabilities can effortlessly command their machines, whether it involves listing files and folders, summarizing documents, accessing real-time data, or delving into a myriad of other functions.

At the heart of AskAI lies its innovative integration of Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech technologies, offering a seamless experience for both visually and hearing impaired users. Through these cutting-edge features, individuals can interact with their computers using their natural voice, transcending the barriers imposed by traditional input methods. Moreover, AskAI introduces a unique push-to-talk input mechanism, enabling users to issue commands effortlessly, enhancing the fluidity and ease of interaction.

$ brew install portaudio ffmpeg libmagic
```

##### GNU/Linux installation

Debian-based systems:

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-pyaudio ffmpeg libmagic-dev
```

RedHat-based systems:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install portaudio-devel redhat-rpm-config ffmpeg libmagic-dev
```
