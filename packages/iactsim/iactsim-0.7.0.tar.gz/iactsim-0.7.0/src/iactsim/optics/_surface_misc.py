class SurfaceType(Enum):
    """
    Enumeration representing the different types of optical surfaces.

    The directionality of reflection and sensitivity (e.g., "from above" or 
    "from below") is defined within the *local reference frame* of the surface at the point 
    of photon incidence. As a reference:

        - the front side of a surface with negative curvature is the convex side.
        - the front side of a surface with posistive curvature is the concave side.

    Attributes
    ----------
    REFLECTIVE : int
        Represents a reflective surface (both sides).
    REFLECTIVE_IN : int
        Represents a surface that is reflective on the front side. 
        In the surface's local reference frame, only photons arriving with a negative 
        z-component of their direction vector (i.e., coming "from the front", or 
        "from above" in the context of the local frame) are reflected. 
        The curvature of the surface does not affect this behavior.
    REFLECTIVE_OUT : int
        Represents a surface that is reflective on the back side. In the surface's 
        local reference frame, only photons arriving with a positive z-component of 
        their direction vector (i.e., coming "from the back", or "from below" in the 
        context of the local frame) are reflected. The curvature of the surface 
        does not affect this behavior.
    REFRACTIVE : int
        Represents a refractive surface. The refraction is the same on both sides.
    SENSITIVE : int
        Represents the focal plane surface where photons are detected. The sensitivity
        is the same on both sides.
    SENSITIVE_IN : int
        Represents a surface that is sensitive on the front side (as defined by the 
        local reference frame's positive z-axis). In the surface's local reference 
        frame, only photons arriving with a negative z-component of their direction 
        vector (i.e., coming "from the front", or "from above" in the context of the 
        local frame) are detected. The curvature of the surface does not affect 
        this behavior.
    SENSITIVE_OUT : int
        Represents a surface that is sensitive on the back side. In the surface's 
        local reference frame, only photons arriving with a positive z-component of 
        their direction vector (i.e., coming "from the back", or "from below" in the 
        context of the local frame) are detected. The curvature of the surface 
        does not affect this behavior.
    OPAQUE : int
        Represents a surface that blocks light.
    DUMMY : int
        Represents a surface that neither reflects nor refracts light. 
        It can be used to introduce artificial absorption or scattering effects, 
        serving as a means to model specific behaviors within the optical system.
