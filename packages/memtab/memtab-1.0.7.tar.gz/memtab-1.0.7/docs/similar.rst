***********************
PyElfTools Library
***********************

The `pyelftools <https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools>`_ library is a pure Python implementation for parsing ELF files. It can be used to extract information from ELF files, including symbol tables and section headers.
One difference is that pyelftools is a library, whereas memtab is a command line tool that produces a specific output format.
Another difference is that pyelftools does not handle ARM binaries, so you will get a lot of not helpful `$d` and `$t` symbols.

***********************
LinkerScope Library
***********************

The `linkerscope <https://github.com/raulgotor/linkerscope>`_ tool is a similar tool that also generates memory usage reports from build outputs.
One difference is this expects a map file as input, rather than an ELF file. This means that it is not able to categorize at the symbol level, but rather at the section level.

***********************
Membrowse
***********************

The `membrowse python package <https://github.com/membrowse/membrowse-action>`_ shares several similarities with memtab, and a few key differences.

Similarities:
  - Both tools analyze ELF files to provide memory usage reports.
  - Both tools provide a GitHub action to expedite integration into CI workflows.
  - Both tools rely on reading the DWARF data out of the ELF file to provide more context about the symbols.

Differences:
  - membrowse requires linker scripts at runtime, not just the elf
  - membrowse is built on pyelftools, whereas memtab is built around the binutils 'nm' command.
  - membrowse provides its own cloud service for storing historical data, whereas memtab is designed to be self-hosted.
    - as part of this, membrowse implements an "onboarding" process to fill out historical data by analyzing previous commits.
  - memtab focuses more on the categorization of symbols
