`bioreqs` is a Python library that defines lightweight client interfaces
for a number of publicly accessible, scientific web APIs, including those from
organizations like the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). In so
doing, it provides users with programmatic access to essential bioinformatics data
without also requiring them to have an overt familiarity with their underlying API
schemata.

## Quick Start

If you're using a dependency manager like `uv` or `poetry` and plan to invoke
`bioreqs` clients from within a project context, simply add it to your
`pyproject.toml` dependency list:

  - ***poetry***: `poetry add bioreqs`
  - ***uv***: `uv add bioreqs`

On the other hand, if you're using vanilla `pip` but still want to work out of a
virtual environment (as you should!), do:

```bash
python -m venv rqenv           # Create a new virtual environment named `rqenv`.
source ./rqenv/bin/activate    # Activate the `rqenv` virtual environment.
pip install --upgrade pip      # Upgrade to the latest version of `pip`.
pip install bioreqs       # Install the `bioreqs` package.
```

Finally, if you only want to use it interactively — or in a script meant to be
invoked by your system-level Python interpreter — you can simply do:

```bash
# Assuming the system-level `pip` binary is in your `PATH` environment variable:
pip install --upgrade pip      # Upgrade to the latest version of `pip`.
pip install bioreqs       # Install the library system-wide.
```

Each of the package's modules corresponds to an individual organization and
implements the relevant API client(s) for that organization. As a convenience,
all clients are also surfaced at the package level, making them directly
available in the `bioreqs` namespace. Thus, for example, to initialize a
client object for the NCBI's popular Entrez E-utilities web API, the following
code suffices:

```python
# Import the Entrez E-utilities API client.
# from bioreqs.ncbi import Entrez
#
# Or, equivalently:
from bioreqs import Entrez

# Initialize the client, providing a valid email address, as required.
client = Entrez("email@example.com")
```

## Clients

Presently, `bioreqs` provides only the above introduced client for the Entrez
E-utilities web API, but it will hopefully tout a much more robust client library
soon enough.

### Entrez E-utilities (NCBI)

Use _bioreqs.ncbi.**Entrez**_ and its instance methods to interact with the
E-utilities web API. Since the NCBI requires one to include their email address
when querying these endpoints, you should call `Entrez` with yours as the first
argument. Alternatively, you can set your system's `NCBI_EMAIL` environment
variable to store your email address; `Entrez` automatically detects it.

```python
from bioreqs import Entrez

# Assuming the `NCBI_EMAIL` environment variable is set to your email address,
# this is a valid invocation of the `Entrez` constructor.
client = Entrez()

```

After creating and storing an instance of the API client (`client`, in the example
above), you call instance methods on that object to query specific endpoints:

```python
# Get the RefSeq for human COL5A2 as a FASTA-formatted string via its accession.
COL5A2_ACCESSION = "NM_000393.5"
COL5A2_REFERENCE = client.get_refseq(COL5A2_ACCESSION)
print(COL5A2_REFERENCE)  # Print the FASTA output.

# Download the FASTA-formatted RefSeq data for human kallikrein-related
# peptidase 15 via its accession, and write it to disk, storing the returned
# output path, if successful.
KLK15_ACCESSION = "NM_001277081.2"
ouput_path = client.save_refseq(KLK15_ACCESSION)

```
