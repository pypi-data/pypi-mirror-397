# 🃏 Blackjack Game

A Python implementation of Blackjack (21) featuring **ASCII card art**, a **chip betting system**, and Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## Features

- Complete Blackjack game logic
- **Beautiful ASCII card visualization**
- **Chip-based betting system** (start with 200 chips)
- **Automatic screen clearing** for better user experience
- **Input filtering** to prevent paste attempts and ensure clean gameplay
- Blackjack Basic Strategy implemented for Dealer
- Player vs Dealer gameplay
- Clean, modular OOP design
- Fully installable package via pip
- Command-line interface

## Installation

### Using a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the game from PyPI
pip install gabrielchaves-blackjack
```

### Updating the game

```bash
# Upgrade to the latest version
pip install --upgrade gabrielchaves-blackjack
```

### From source (optional)

```bash
# Clone or download the repository
cd blackjack

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Or install normally
pip install .
```

### After installation

```bash
# Run the game
blackjack
```

---

## How to Play

1. Run the `blackjack` command after installation
2. **Place your bet** - Choose from 1, 5, 10, 25, or 50 chips
3. You'll receive 2 cards, the dealer receives 2 (one hidden)
4. Choose **Hit** (take a card) or **Stand** (keep your current hand)
5. Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over
6. The dealer plays automatically (follows Basic Strategy)
7. The highest hand wins!
8. **Win**: Get your bet back doubled
9. **Lose**: Lose your bet
10. **Push**: Bet is returned on a tie
11. Game continues until you run out of chips or choose to quit

## Betting System

- Start with **200 chips**
- Betting options: **1, 5, 10, 25, or 50 chips**
- Win your bet amount on a win
- Lose your bet amount on a loss
- Bet returned on a push (tie)
- Game ends when you run out of chips
- Option to start a new game with 200 chips

## ASCII Visualization

Cards are displayed in beautiful ASCII art:

```
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│A        │  │K        │  │Q        │
│         │  │         │  │         │
│    ♠    │  │    ♥    │  │    ♦    │
│         │  │         │  │         │
│        A│  │        K│  │        Q│
└─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘
```

The dealer's hidden card appears as:
```
┌─────────┐
│░░░░░░░░░│
│░░░░░░░░░│
│░░░░░░░░░│
│░░░░░░░░░│
│░░░░░░░░░│
└─────────┘
```

## Usage as Module
```python
from blackjack import BlackJackGame

# Create and play a game
game = BlackJackGame()
game.play_round()
```

## Card Art Demo

To see cards in ASCII art:
```bash
python demo_ascii_cards.py
```

## Architecture

### Design Principles

This implementation follows solid OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Each class manages its own data and behavior
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a clear, focused purpose
- **Composition**: Game uses Deck, Players use Hands
- **Inheritance**: Dealer extends Player with specific rules
- **Separation of Concerns**: Input handling, game logic, and display are separated

### Class Structure

- **Card**: Represents a single playing card (with ASCII art)
- **Deck**: Manages a 52-card deck (creation, shuffling, dealing)
- **Hand**: Manages a collection of cards and calculates values
- **Player**: Represents a player with a hand and chips
- **Dealer**: Extends Player with specific dealer rules and Basic Strategy
- **BlackJackGame**: Orchestrates game flow and logic
- **CLI**: Command-line interface with betting flow
- **InputHandler**: Filtered input system to prevent paste attempts

### Key Implementation Details

#### Card Values
- Number cards (2-10): Face value
- Face cards (J, Q, K): 10 points
- Aces: 11 points (no soft/hard handling in current version)

#### Dealer Strategy
The dealer follows Blackjack Basic Strategy:
- **Hard hands**: 
  - Hits on 16 or less
  - Stands on 17 or more
- **Soft hands** (with Ace):
  - Complex strategy based on up card
  - Optimized for realistic gameplay

#### Input Security
- **Paste prevention**: All paste attempts (Ctrl+V, Cmd+V, right-click) are blocked
- **Character filtering**: Only valid single-character inputs accepted
- **Clean experience**: Invalid inputs are silently ignored

### Improvements Implemented

✅ **ASCII card art**: Beautiful, immersive visualization
✅ **Chip betting system**: Realistic casino-style betting
✅ **Screen clearing**: Clean, professional interface
✅ **Smooth animations**: Strategic pauses for better experience
✅ **Emojis**: Fun visual feedback
✅ **Input filtering**: Prevents cheating and ensures fair play
✅ **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
✅ **UTF-8 encoding handling**: Proper character display across systems

## Testing
```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/
```

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `prompt-toolkit` for enhanced input handling

## Game Rules

1. Get as close to 21 as possible without going over
2. Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points
3. Aces are worth 11 points
4. Number cards are worth their face value
5. Going over 21 is a "bust" - you lose automatically
6. Dealer must hit on 16 or less
7. If both player and dealer have the same value, it's a "push" (tie)
