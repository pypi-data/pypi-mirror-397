abstract: >-
  Kateryna is an epistemic uncertainty layer that wraps any LLM to detect
  and prevent hallucinations. Based on 1958 Soviet Setun ternary computing
  research, it introduces a third state beyond true/false: uncertain.

  The key insight: a confident LLM response without RAG grounding is the
  hallucination danger zone. Traditional confidence scores miss this because
  they don't ask "Is the confidence justified?"

  Named after Kateryna Yushchenko (1919-2001), Ukrainian computer scientist
  who invented indirect addressing (pointers) in 1955.
