## Who created pmid2cite.com?
**What are the doing with your data?**    

Previously, in the not-too-distant past, the following website _appeared_ to be useful for non-CLI (Command Line Interface) researchers:
pmid2cite.com (DO NOT GO THERE).
It was **always** unclear who created it.

And it is now a gambling site.
So I do not even know...
Do not click on it.

<!--- (https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/87688178) -->
There _was_ no "About Us" or "Our Team" section.
And when you in _clicked_ on the privacy policy in the past, this appeared:
