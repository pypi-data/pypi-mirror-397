# MCPScanner

MCPScanner is a command-line tool for analyzing MCP servers. It does the
following:

1. **Discovers MCP Servers**: It automatically searches for MCP server
   configuration files in well-known locations on the host system.
2. **Analyzes Tools and Resources**: It connects to each discovered server to
   fetch the list of available tools and resources.
3. **Security Scanning with CrowdStrike AIDR**: It uses the CrowdStrike AIDR
   service to scan the tools for malicious entities and prompts.
4. **Generates Reports**: It creates a JSON report (default `mcpscanner.json`)
   containing the analysis results.
5. **Detects Changes**: It can compare the current state of a server's tools
   with a previous report and display a diff if any changes are detected.
6. **Finds Similar Tools**: It can identify tools with similar functionality.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U crowdstrike-aidr-mcpscanner
```

## Configuration

Before using MCPScanner, you need to set the `CS_AIDR_TOKEN` environment
variable to a CrowdStrike AIDR API token and the `CS_AIDR_BASE_URL_TEMPLATE`
environment variable to the base URL of the CrowdStrike AIDR API.

```bash
export CS_AIDR_TOKEN="your_token_here"
export CS_AIDR_BASE_URL_TEMPLATE="https://api.crowdstrike.com/aidr/{SERVICE_NAME}"
```

## Usage

The primary command is `scan`, which runs the analysis.

```bash
mcpscanner scan
```
