class Analyse:
    """This class is the base class for all the analyse classes. It provides a common interface for all the classes. Its purpose is to provide the basic silent functions to open, create and save algorithms, and to store the different steps of the analysis and their effects on the data.
    The philosophy of this class is to rely on 4 attributes that will be changed by the different functions of the class:
    - x: the x-axis of the data
    - y: the y-axis of the data
    - points: a list of remarkable points in the data where each point is a 2-list of the form [position, type]
    - windows: a list of windows in the data where each window is a 2-list of the form [start, end]
    And to store the different steps of the analysis and their effects on the data:
    - _algorithm: a dictionary that stores the name of the algorithm, its version, the author, and a description
    - _history: a list that stores the evolution of the 4 main attributes of the class with the steps of the analysis.
    The data is defined by 2 1-D arrays: x and y. Additionally, remarkable points and windows are stored in the points and windows attributes.
    Algorithm steps are stored in 2 attributes: _algorithm and _history. The _algorithm attribute is a dictionary that stores the name of the algorithm, its version, the author, and a description. The _history attribute is a list that stores the steps of the analysis and their effects on the data.
    The _execute attribute is a boolean that indicates whether the analysis should be executed or not. It is set to True by default. The _auto_run attribute is a boolean that indicates whether the analysis should be executed automatically or not. It is set to False by default.
    As a general rule, we encourage developers not to modify any of the underscore-prefixed attributes. These attributes are meant to be used internally by the mother class to run, save, and load the analysis and its history.
    All the functions of the class are functions with a zero-argument call signature that returns None. This means that the parameters of the methods of the children class need to be kew-word arguments, and that if no value for these arguments are given, the default value of the arguments leads the function to do nothing. This specificality ensures the modulability of the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : np.ndarray
        The x-axis of the data.
    y : np.ndarray
        The y-axis of the data.

    _algorithm : dict
        The algorithm used to analyse the data.
    _history : list
        The history of the analysis.

Considering that only one Brillouin Stokes and anti-Stokes doublet is visible on the spectrum, the user can select the peaks he sees, and then perform a quadratic interpolation to obtain the frequency axis. This interpolation is obtained either by entering a value for the Brillouin shift of the material or by entering the value of the Free Spectral Range (FSR) of the spectrometer. The user can finally recenter the spectrum either using the average between a Stokes and an anti-Stokes peak or by choosing an elastic peak as zero frequency.")
