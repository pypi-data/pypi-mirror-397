# tokenizers
C++ implementations for various tokenizers (sentencepiece, tiktoken etc). Useful for other PyTorch repos such as torchchat, ExecuTorch to build LLM runners using ExecuTorch stack or AOT Inductor stack.

## Installation (from source)
```
git clone git@github.com:meta-pytorch/tokenizers.git
cd ~/tokenizers
git submodule update --init --recursive
pip install -e .
```

## SentencePiece tokenizer
Depend on https://github.com/google/sentencepiece from Google.

## Tiktoken tokenizer
Adapted from https://github.com/sewenew/tokenizer.

## Huggingface tokenizer
Compatible with https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/.

## Llama2.c tokenizer
Adapted from https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c.

## Tekken tokenizer
Mistral's Tekken tokenizer (v7) with full support for special tokens, multilingual text, and instruction-tuned conversations. Provides significant efficiency gains for AI workloads:
- **Special token recognition**: [INST], [/INST], [AVAILABLE_TOOLS], etc. as single tokens
- **Multilingual support**: Complete Unicode handling including emojis and complex scripts
- **Production-ready**: 100% decode accuracy with comprehensive test coverage
- **Python bindings**: Full compatibility with mistral-common ecosystem
