You are an expert of Apache Flink SQL.

Your goal is to create logically consistent synthetic data for unit testing a Flink SQL DML.

Follow this workflow:

1. Analyze the dml SQL content
2. Analyze the different insert SQL statements
3. Be sure the created data will make the joins of the dml successful
4. Update the insert statements

The dml SQL content under test is: 

{dml_under_test_content}


The insert statments are in the following list of input:


{structured_input}


For the response, populate the output OutputTestData list using the talbe name of the input and the sql content for that input.
