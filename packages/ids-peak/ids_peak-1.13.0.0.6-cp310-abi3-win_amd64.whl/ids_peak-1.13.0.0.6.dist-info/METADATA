ids_peak provides python bindings
for the IDS peak genericAPI. It exposes all the
functionality of the peak genericAPI and __requires__
at least the drivers and GenICam transport layers to be installed,
which are included in the IDS peak SDK.

Benefit from many Python __advantages__, for example the __interactive__
programming of your IDS camera.
Write and test small code snippets
without the complex setup of a programming IDE including a toolchain.
This package is __ideal for prototyping__ IDS
camera applications for all supported peak genericAPI platforms
(Windows, Linux, Linux Embedded).

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install ids_peak
```

## Quickstart

This example shows how to open a device, start image acquisition
and how to convert a buffer to an `ids_peak_ipl.Image`.

NOTE: *For the sake of simplicity, most of the error checking has been
omitted in this example.*

```python
from ids_peak import ids_peak
from ids_peak import ids_peak_ipl_extension


def main():
    # Initialize library
    ids_peak.Library.Initialize()

    # Create a DeviceManager object
    device_manager = ids_peak.DeviceManager.Instance()

    try:
        # The returned callback object needs to be stored in a variable and
        # needs to live as long as the class that would call it,
        # so as long as the device manager in this case
        # If the callback gets garbage collected it deregisters itself
        device_found_callback = device_manager.DeviceFoundCallback(
            lambda found_device: print(
                "Found-Device-Callback: Key={}".format(
                    found_device.Key()), end="\n\n"))

            device_found_callback)

        # Update the DeviceManager
        device_manager.Update()
        # The callback can also be unregistered explicitly using the returned
        # handle
        device_manager.UnregisterDeviceFoundCallback(
            device_found_callback_handle)

## Documentation

Documentation is available [here](https://en.ids-imaging.com/manuals/ids-peak/ids-peak-api-documentation/en/index.html)

## Troubleshoot

### Windows Runtime DLL Conflict (PyQt / MSVCP140.dll)

#### Problem

On Windows, PyQt ships with its own copies of Microsoft runtime libraries, such as:

```
msvcp140.dll
vcruntime140.dll
```

These DLLs are usually **older** than the ones installed by the official
**Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (2015–2022)**.

IDS peak genericAPI is compiled with a **newer MSVC toolset**,
Windows may load the *outdated* DLLs from the PyQt package first.
This can cause runtime errors such as:

```
OSError: [WinError 1114] A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed
```

---

#### Workaround in Python

To ensure IDS peak genericAPI uses the **newer system runtime** instead of
PyQt’s local DLLs, you can import IDS peak genericAPI *before* PyQt.

```python

from ids_peak import ids_peak
from PyQt5 import QtCore  # or PyQt6 / etc.

## Continue with the rest of your program
```

This ensures that your extension module links against the **newer runtime DLLs**
from `C:\Windows\System32`, before PyQt’s versions are loaded.

---

#### Workaround in PyQt Installation

If you can modify the PyQt installation, you can safely **rename or remove**
the bundled runtime DLLs in the PyQt package:

```
<python>\Lib\site-packages\PyQt<version>\Qt\bin\msvcp140.dll
<python>\Lib\site-packages\PyQt<version>\Qt\bin\vcruntime140.dll
```

Rename them to:

```
msvcp140.dll.old
vcruntime140.dll.old
```

Windows will then automatically use the system-wide (and up-to-date)
runtime libraries from the Visual C++ Redistributable.
