# Theoretical Foundation of LayerLens

LayerLens builds upon several theoretical concepts in explainable AI to provide a comprehensive approach to understanding deep learning models.

## Layer-wise Explanation

Deep neural networks can be viewed as a composition of functions, where each layer transforms its input to a new representation. Formally:

$$f(x) = f_L \circ f_{L-1} \circ ... \circ f_1(x)$$

Instead of treating the model as a black box, LayerLens explains each transformation $f_i$ individually, which provides a more granular understanding.

## Surrogate Models

For each layer $f_i$, LayerLens creates a surrogate model $g_i$ that approximates the behavior of the layer but is inherently interpretable. The surrogate model is trained to minimize:

$$\mathcal{L}(g_i, f_i) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}}[d(g_i(x), f_i(x))]$$

where $d$ is a distance function and $\mathcal{D}$ is the data distribution.

## Fidelity Metrics

The quality of explanations is measured using fidelity metrics that quantify how well the surrogate models approximate the original layers:

1. **Local Fidelity**: How well the surrogate matches the original layer for a specific input
2. **Global Fidelity**: How well the surrogate matches the original layer across all inputs
3. **Compositional Fidelity**: How well the composed surrogates match the entire model

## Hierarchical Explanation

LayerLens stitches together layer-wise explanations to form a hierarchical view of the model. This approach has several advantages:

1. It respects the compositional nature of deep learning models
2. It allows for multiple levels of abstraction in explanations
3. It enables the identification of specific layers that contribute to certain behaviors

## Theoretical Guarantees

Under certain conditions, LayerLens provides theoretical guarantees on explanation quality:

1. **Completeness**: The explanations account for all relevant factors in the model's behavior
2. **Consistency**: Similar models receive similar explanations
3. **Locality**: The explanations accurately reflect the model's behavior in the neighborhood of the input
