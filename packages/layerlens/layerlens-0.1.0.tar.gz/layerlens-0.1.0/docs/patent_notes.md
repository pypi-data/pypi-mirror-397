# Patent Notes for LayerLens

This document contains confidential information related to potential patent applications for the LayerLens technology. Access should be restricted to authorized personnel only.

## Novel Technical Contributions

1. **Hierarchical Surrogate Stitching Algorithm**
   - Method for connecting layer-wise surrogate models
   - Ensures consistency between layer explanations
   - Patent potential: HIGH

2. **Adaptive Surrogate Model Selection**
   - Automatically selects the most appropriate surrogate model type for each layer
   - Uses novel metrics to determine model suitability
   - Patent potential: MEDIUM

3. **Layer-wise Fidelity Bounds**
   - Mathematical framework for quantifying explanation quality
   - Provides theoretical guarantees on explanation accuracy
   - Patent potential: HIGH

4. **Feature Flow Visualization**
   - Novel visualization technique for tracing feature importance through layers
   - Interactive interface for exploring feature transformations
   - Patent potential: MEDIUM

5. **Failure Localization Technique**
   - Method for pinpointing which layer caused a model to fail
   - Uses counterfactual reasoning across layer boundaries
   - Patent potential: HIGH

## Prior Art Analysis

A preliminary analysis indicates no direct prior art for our hierarchical surrogate approach. However, the following works should be considered:

1. SHAP (Lundberg & Lee, 2017) - General framework for additive explanations
2. LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) - Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations
3. DeepLIFT (Shrikumar et al., 2017) - Layer-wise relevance propagation

## Next Steps for IP Protection

1. Complete detailed invention disclosures for top three patent candidates
2. Schedule meeting with patent counsel to discuss filing strategy
3. Implement appropriate code protections and documentation
4. Consider provisional patent application filing by Q2 2023
