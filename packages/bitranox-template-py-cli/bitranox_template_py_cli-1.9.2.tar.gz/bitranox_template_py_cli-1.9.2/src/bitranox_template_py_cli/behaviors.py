"""Domain-level behaviors supporting the minimal CLI transport.

Collects the placeholder behaviors that the CLI adapter exposes so that each
concern remains self-contained. Keeping these helpers together makes it easy to
swap in richer logging logic later without touching the transport surface.

Functions:
    emit_greeting: Success-path helper that writes the canonical scaffold message.
    raise_intentional_failure: Deterministic error hook used by tests and CLI
        flows to validate traceback handling.
    noop_main: Placeholder entry used when callers expect a ``main`` callable
        despite the domain layer being stubbed today.

Note:
    Acts as the temporary domain surface for this template. Other modules import
    from here instead of duplicating literals so the public API stays coherent as
    features evolve.
