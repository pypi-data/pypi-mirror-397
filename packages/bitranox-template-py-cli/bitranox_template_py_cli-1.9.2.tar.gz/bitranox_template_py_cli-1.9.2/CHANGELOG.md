- Updated CI workflow to use `rtoml` instead of version-conditional `tomli`/`tomllib`

## [1.9.1] - 2025-12-15

### Changed
- Bumped `lib_cli_exit_tools` dependency from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2
- Bumped `ruff` dev dependency from 0.14.8 to 0.14.9
- Bumped `textual` dev dependency from 6.8.0 to 6.9.0
- Added `rtoml>=0.13.0` dev dependency for TOML parsing
- Updated GitHub Actions `actions/cache` from v4 to v5 in CI workflow
- Updated GitHub Actions `actions/upload-artifact` from v5 to v6 in release workflow
- Reformatted docstrings in `__init__conf__.py` to follow consistent structure

## [1.9.0] - 2025-12-11

### Changed
- Broadened Python compatibility from 3.13+ to 3.10+
- Updated `target-version` in ruff configuration from `py313` to `py310`
- Updated documentation to reflect Python 3.10+ support

## [1.8.1] - 2025-12-08

### Changed
- Bumped `lib_cli_exit_tools` dependency from 2.1.0 to 2.1.1
- Bumped `import-linter` dev dependency from 2.7 to 2.8

### Fixed
- Added `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` to CI workflow to prevent encoding issues

## [1.8.0] - 2025-12-07

### Changed
- Enforced strict data architecture rules across all source and test files:
  - Replaced raw dict usage in Click context with typed `CLIContextData` dataclass
  - Added `ClickContextSettings` dataclass for Click context configuration
  - Converted `TypedDict` to `@dataclass` in test fixtures for type safety
- Refactored test suite to clean architecture principles:
  - `conftest.py`: Centralized fixtures with immutable `CLIConfigSnapshot` dataclass
  - `test_behaviors.py`: 10 focused tests for core behaviors
  - `test_cli.py`: 29 tests using real CLI execution via `CliRunner`
  - `test_metadata.py`: 20 tests validating pyproject.toml synchronization
  - `test_module_entry.py`: 14 tests for module entry point via `runpy`
- All 79 tests now marked with `@pytest.mark.os_agnostic` for cross-platform clarity
- Increased test coverage to 94.51% (88 tests including doctests)

### Fixed
- Eliminated all raw dict parameter violations in production code
- Removed dict key access patterns (`ctx.obj["key"]`) in favour of typed field
  access (`context_data.field`)
- Fixed pyright type errors in test files with proper type annotations

### Documentation
- Clarified `--no-traceback` as the default error display mode in README
- Added Traceback Mode section explaining `--traceback` vs `--no-traceback` usage

## [1.7.0] - 2025-10-13
### Added
- Static metadata portrait generated from ``pyproject.toml`` and exported via
  ``bitranox_template_py_cli.__init__conf__``; automation keeps the constants in
  sync during tests and push workflows.
- Help-first CLI experience: invoking the command without subcommands now
  prints the rich-click help screen; ``--traceback`` without subcommands still
  executes the placeholder domain entry.
- `ProjectMetadata` now captures version, summary, author, and console-script
  name, providing richer diagnostics for automation scripts.

### Changed
- Refactored CLI helpers into prose-like functions with explicit docstrings for
  intent, inputs, outputs, and side effects.
- Overhauled module headers and system design docs to align with the clean
  narrative style; `docs/systemdesign/module_reference.md` reflects every helper.
- Scripts (`test`, `push`) synchronise metadata before running, ensuring the
  portrait stays current without runtime lookups.

### Fixed
- Eliminated runtime dependency on ``importlib.metadata`` by generating the
  metadata file ahead of time, removing a failure point in minimal installs.
- Hardened tests around CLI help output, metadata constants, and automation
  scripts to keep coverage exhaustive.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-10-10

### Added
- Type-hardened CLI, module-entry, and behaviour tests covering metadata output
  and invalid command handling.
- Import-linter contract aligning the CLI with the behaviour module structure.

### Changed
- Removed stale packaging references (Conda/Homebrew/Nix) from documentation and
  environment templates.
- Updated contributor and development guides to reflect the streamlined build
  workflow.
- Removed all legacy compatibility shims; only the canonical behaviour helpers
  remain exported.

### Fixed
- Eliminated tracked coverage artifacts and unused dev-only dependencies.

## [0.0.1] - 2025-09-25
- Bootstrap `bitranox_template_py_cli` using the shared scaffold.
- Replace implementation-specific modules with placeholders ready for Rich-based logging.
