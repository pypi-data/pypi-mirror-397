pyearcal
========
Generate your year calendar in Python. The result is a PDF file with 12 pages containing an image and a grid of days.

### Installation

We recommend using [uv tool](https://uvtool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to use and/or install pyearcal as a tool.

```
uv tool install pyearcal
```

or you can use it without installation (via `uvx`)

### Usage

1. Prepare a directory with 12 images (different image providers are planned)
2. Initialize calendar with all options.
    * Language (locales for English, Czech, Slovak, Italian)
    * Special days (national holidays are included + add your own)
    * Fonts, colours
3. Render it to PDF

### Usage of the script

```
Usage: uvx pyearcal [OPTIONS] [OUTPUT]

Options:
  -s, --source PATH
  -l, --locale [en|cs|it|sk]
  -y, --year INTEGER
  -f, --font TEXT
  -d, --special-days TEXT
  ```

### Example code

```python
# Import important modules
from pyearcal import YearCalendar
from pyearcal.image_sources import UnsortedImageDirectory
from datetime import date
from pyearcal.l10n import CzechLocale

year = date.today().year + 1

# Use all pictures from "images" directory
image_source = UnsortedImageDirectory("images")

# Use Czech locale and holidays
locale = CzechLocale()

# Set a few special days
special_days = [
    date(year, 1, 31) # Guido van Rossum's birthday
]

calendar = YearCalendar(year, image_source, locale, special_days)
calendar.render("calendar.pdf")
```

You can take **FlickrDownloader** as an inspiration for developing a more sophisticated image source.
