﻿# Ked
*simple text editor for the terminal*

Ked is a single-file text editor that runs in the terminal. Its interface is
intentionally simple, while its default key bindings resemble those of desktop
applications.


## Installation

Install the application with the [UV] package manager:
```
uv tool install Ked
```

There are other ways to install the app, such as via [PipX] or even just [Pip].
But UV is recommended as it isolates and manages all dependencies, including
Python.

## Usage

Simply run
```
ked some_file.txt
```

to edit a file. Run `ked --help` to list further command-line options. Press
<kbd>F1</kbd> in the app for help on interactive usage.
