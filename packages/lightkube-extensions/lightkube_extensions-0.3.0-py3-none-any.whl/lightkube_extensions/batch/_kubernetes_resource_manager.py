        Args:
            logger (logging.Logger): (Optional) A logger to use for logging (so that log messages
                                     emitted here will appear under the caller's log namespace).
                                     If not provided, a default logger will be created.
            labels (dict): A dict of labels to use as a label selector for all resources
                           managed by this KRM.  These will be added to any applied resources at
                           .apply() time and will be used to find existing resources in

                           Recommended input for this is:

                           See `get_default_labels` for a helper to generate this label dict.
            resource_types (set): Set of Lightkube Resource objects that define the
                                  types of child resources managed by this KRM. Required so KRM can
                                  query the cluster for existing resources to reconcile.
            lightkube_client (lightkube.Client): Lightkube Client to use for all k8s operations.
                                                 This Client must be instantiated with a
