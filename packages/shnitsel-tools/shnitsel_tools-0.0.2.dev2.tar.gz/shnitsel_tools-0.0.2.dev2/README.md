## About

`shnitsel-tools` is designed to to support the entire data lifecycle of surface hopping (SH) trajectory data upon simulation: data managment, storage, processing, visualization and interpretation. 
The tool is compatible with surface hopping data generated using the software packages [SHARC 3/4](https://sharc-md.org/), [Newton-X](https://newtonx.org/), and [PyRAI2MD](https://github.com/lopez-lab/PyRAI2MD).
The package leverages [Xarray](https://xarray.dev/) to benefit from efficient multidimensional data handling, improved metadata management, and a structure that aligns naturally with the needs of quantum chemical datasets.

## Installation

`shnitsel-tools` is normally used interactively via Jupyter Notebook on a local machine.
However, some users might find it convenient to convert trajectories to NetCDF
on-cluster, as the NetCDF file will likely download faster than the raw text files.
Either way the following should work as usual, ideally in a fresh virtual (e.g. `conda`) environment:

<!-- TODO: remove --pre once full release out -->
  ```bash
  pip install shnitsel-tools[vis]
  ```

For more detailed installation instructions, see [here](#detailed-installation-instructions)

## Usage

For documentation including an API reference, please see https://shnitsel.github.io/tools/docs/_build/index.html.

`shnitsel-tools` mostly exposes data as Xarray (`xr`) objects, so familiarity with that library is beneficial.
Xarray is somewhat like Pandas for higher-dimensional data, or like Numpy with labels and other metadata.

### Tutorials
For a quick start, see the [tutorials](https://github.com/SHNITSEL/shnitsel-tools/blob/main/tutorials) directory,
which contains Jupyter Notebooks showing the workflow for parsing, writing and loading SHNITSEL databases as well as how to postprocess and visualize the respective data.

### Workflow walkthrough
Four [notebooks](https://github.com/SHNITSEL/shnitsel-tools/tree/main/tutorials/walkthrough) demonstrate a workflow for the comparative
analysis of homologous/isoelectronic molecules, from filtration via dimensional reduction and clustering to kinetics.

## Detailed installation instructions

### Optional dependencies
In the following, the `[vis]` suffix causes optional plotting dependencies to be
installed. If you are using `shnitsel-tools` on an HPC, you can omit it.

If you would like to contribute to `shnitsel-tools`, you may find the development
dependencies useful. These can be obtained by adding `[dev]` at the end of the
package name.

To install all optional dependencies, please add `[vis,dev]` after the package name.

### Using conda
Before anything else, please run:
```bash
conda create -n shnitsel python==3.12 pip
conda activate shnitsel
```

#### For tutorials or development
If you would like to work through the tutorials, please use the following commands
while the conda environment is active:
<!-- TODO: remove git-switch command once full release version comes out -->
```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/SHNITSEL/shnitsel-tools.git'
cd shnitsel-tools
git switch develop
pip install .[vis]
```

If you would like changes you make to the code in the `shnitsel-tools` directory
to be reflected in your environment, please add the `-e` flag ("editable mode") to the
final line of the above block:
```bash
# Same commands as before, and then:
pip install -e .[vis]  # or .[vis,dev] to include development tools
```

#### For ordinary use
If you would just like to use the package, it is unnecessary to clone the repository.
Instead, it should suffice to run the following command with the conda environment active:

<!-- TODO: remove --pre once full release version comes out -->
```bash
pip install --pre shnitsel-tools[vis]
```

### Using uv

This tool, available at  https://docs.astral.sh/uv/, is typically faster and
more light-weight than `pip` and `conda`.
Unlike `conda`, it creates traditional Python virtual environments, which are
stored in the folder in which the command is run and activated by sourcing
a shell-script.

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/SHNITSEL/shnitsel-tools.git'
cd shnitsel-tools

uv pip install -e .[dev]  # install shnitsel in editable mode
```

#### For tutorials or development
If you would like to work through the tutorials, please use the following commands:
<!-- TODO: remove git-switch command once full release version comes out -->
```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/SHNITSEL/shnitsel-tools.git'
cd shnitsel-tools
git switch develop
uv venv --python 3.12  # create an environment under ./.venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # activate the new environment
uv pip install .[vis]
```

If you would like changes you make to the code in the `shnitsel-tools` directory
to be reflected in your environment, please add the `-e` flag ("editable mode") to the
final line of the above block:
```bash
# Same commands as before, and then:
uv pip install -e .[vis]  # or .[vis,dev] to include development tools
```

#### For command-line only use
The following will ensure the command-line programs provided are always available,
without requiring environments to be activated first.
```bash
uv tool install --pre shnitsel-tools
```

#### For ordinary use
If you would just like to use the package, it is unnecessary to clone the repository.
Instead, it should suffice to run the following commands:

<!-- TODO: remove --pre once full release version comes out -->
```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 shnitsel  # creates a directory here called ./shnitsel
source shnitsel/bin/activate  # activate the new environment
uv pip install --pre shnitsel-tools[vis]
```

<!--
### For developers
  
  We recommend installation using the `uv` tool, available at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/.
  Please clone this repo and run the following in the `shnitsel-tools` directory:

  ```bash
  git clone 'https://github.com/SHNITSEL/shnitsel-tools.git'
  cd shnitsel-tools
  uv venv  # create an environment under ./.venv
  source .venv/bin/activate  # activate the new environment
  uv pip install -e .[dev]  # install shnitsel in editable mode
  ```

  In the above, the option `-e` installs in editable mode, meaning that Python will see changes you make
  to the source, while `[dev]` installs the optional development dependencies.  

  If you would like to contribute your changes,
  please [fork](https://github.com/SHNITSEL/shnitsel-tools/fork) this repo,
  and make a pull request.
