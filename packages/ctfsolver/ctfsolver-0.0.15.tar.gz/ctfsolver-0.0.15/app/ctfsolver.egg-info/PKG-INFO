# CTFSolverScript

CTFSolverScript is a tool designed to assist in solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. It provides utilities and scripts to streamline the process of solving various types of CTF problems.

This library has been created to suit my needs.

What I mean is, I was developing it when I was solving CTF challenges.
By solving the ctf's with python, and automating the solutions, I collected many scripts.

Some functionalities came by request, some I implemented out of personal interest.

Some things will seem weird to others, such as the structure of the challenge folder, and the keywords used.

The documentation is still under development.

## Features

- **Automated Scripts**: Pre-built scripts for common CTF tasks.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable to add custom scripts.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Installation

[installation instructions can be found here.](docs/sphinx/source/modules/installation.md)

## Usage

Can be used as a class for scripting and as a cli tool

```bash
ctfsolver --help
```

```
ctfsolver help
```

[detailed usage instructions can be found here.](docs/sphinx/source/modules/usage.md)

[Automated Documentation can be found here.](https://nikolasfil.github.io/CTFSolverScript/)

When the repo is cloned locally you can find pdoc and sphinx generated documentation in the docs/ folder.

```bash
make doc-pdoc-host
```

```bash
make doc-sphinx-host
```
