# CTFSolverScript

CTFSolverScript is a tool designed to assist in solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. It provides utilities and scripts to streamline the process of solving various types of CTF problems.

This library has been created to suit my needs.

What I mean is, I was developing it when I was solving CTF challenges.
By solving the ctf's with python, and automating the solutions, I collected many scripts.

Some functionalities came by request, some I implemented out of personal interest.

Some things will seem weird to others, such as the structure of the challenge folder, and the keywords used.

The documentation is still under development.

## Features

- **Automated Scripts**: Pre-built scripts for common CTF tasks.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable to add custom scripts.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
