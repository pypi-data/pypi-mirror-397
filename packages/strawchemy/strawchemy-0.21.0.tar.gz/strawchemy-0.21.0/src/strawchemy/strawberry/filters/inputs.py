"""GraphQL filter definitions for DTOs.

This module defines classes and type aliases for creating GraphQL filters
used in data transfer objects (DTOs). It includes comparison classes for
various data types, such as numeric, text, JSONB, arrays, dates, times,
and geometries. These classes allow for building boolean expressions to
compare fields of DTOs in GraphQL queries.
