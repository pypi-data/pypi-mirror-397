**Automate your automations.**
*Production flow calculations for Satisfactory.*

> [!NOTE]
> Heads up: the AI cooked dinner. It's edible, but watch your step.  
> Detailed bug reports welcome.

## 🚀 Quick Start

That’s it. ✨

---

### ⚖️ License
- [MIT-a-NOAI License](LICENSE)

You’re free to use, copy, and modify the script under the standard MIT terms.  
The additional rider simply requests that this project not be used to train or fine-tune AI/ML systems until the author deems fair compensation frameworks exist.  
Normal use, packaging, and redistribution for human developers are unaffected.

## 💡 Why Python? Other Language Versions?

You don’t need a native build.  
Python 3 ships with most Linux distributions. On Mac, it's one homebrew command away. On Windows, running the script automatically prompts the user to install Python from the Microsoft Store.

## 🪶 Summary

**Use it. Hack it. Ship it.**
It’s MIT-licensed, minimal, and meant to stay out of your way — just with one polite request: don’t feed it to the AIs (yet).
