# adaptivegears

CLI tools for data engineering workflows. Part of the [Adaptive Gears](https://adaptivegears.studio) ecosystem.

## Why

We document patterns in our knowledge base. But patterns without tools are just theory.

This library closes the loop: tools we actually use at work become the examples in our articles. When we write about UUID v7 for time-sortable identifiers, we're using `adaptivegears uuid -7`. When we document PostgreSQL introspection, we're running `adaptivegears pg list`.

The constraint: keep the core light. Heavy dependencies (psycopg, boto3) live in extras. You pay for what you use.

## Install

```bash
uvx adaptivegears --help
```

No install needed. [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) runs it directly from PyPI.

## Commands

### uuid

Generate UUIDs. v4 by default, v7 for time-sortable.

```bash
uvx adaptivegears uuid           # v4
uvx adaptivegears uuid -7        # v7 (time-sortable)
uvx adaptivegears uuid -7 -n 5   # multiple
```

### pg

PostgreSQL utilities. Requires `[pg]` extra and `DATABASE_URL`.

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname"

uvx 'adaptivegears[pg]' pg list                # tables in public schema
uvx 'adaptivegears[pg]' pg list -s myschema    # different schema
uvx 'adaptivegears[pg]' pg list --json         # machine-readable
```

## Extras

Heavy dependencies are optional:

| Extra | Dependencies | Commands |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| `pg` | psycopg | `pg list` |
| `s3` | boto3 | *(coming)* |
| `all` | everything | all commands |

```bash
uvx 'adaptivegears[pg]' ...
uvx 'adaptivegears[all]' ...
```

## Claude Code

These tools work well with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code).

For repetitive tasks, Claude Code tends to write solutions from scratch. It usually works. But edge cases accumulate in places you wouldn't expect - bit layouts, parsing quirks, format inconsistencies.

This library provides polished alternatives. Instead of generating throwaway scripts, Claude Code can reach for tested implementations. The `--json` flag ensures consistent output for further processing.

The tools grow from patterns we've already debugged. Less re-invention, fewer surprises, fewer tokens.
