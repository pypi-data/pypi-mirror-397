# Codon LangGraph Adapter

If you're already using LangGraph, the Codon SDK provides seamless integration through the `LangGraphWorkloadAdapter`. This allows you to wrap your existing StateGraphs with minimal code changes while gaining comprehensive telemetry and observability.

## Deprecation Notice (LangGraph 0.3.x)

Support for LangGraph 0.3.x is deprecated and will be removed after the `0.1.0a5` release of `codon-instrumentation-langgraph`. If you need to stay on LangGraph 0.3.x, pin this package at `<=0.1.0a5`. Starting with `0.2.0a0`, the adapter will support only LangChain/LangGraph v1.x.

### python-warnings

When running with LangGraph 0.3.x you will see a `DeprecationWarning` explaining the cutoff. To silence the warning, set:

```
CODON_LANGGRAPH_DEPRECATION_SILENCE=1
```

## Understanding State Graph vs Compiled Graph

LangGraph has two distinct graph representations:
- **State Graph**: The graph you define and add nodes to during development
- **Compiled Graph**: The executable version created when you want to run the graph

The `LangGraphWorkloadAdapter` works by wrapping your StateGraph and compiling it for you, allowing you to pass compile keyword arguments for features like checkpointers and long-term memory.

## Using LangGraphWorkloadAdapter

The primary way to integrate LangGraph with Codon is through the `LangGraphWorkloadAdapter.from_langgraph()` method:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from codon.instrumentation.langgraph import LangGraphWorkloadAdapter

# Your existing StateGraph
db_agent_graph = StateGraph(SQLAnalysisState)
db_agent_graph.add_node("query_resolver_node", self.query_resolver_node)
db_agent_graph.add_node("query_executor_node", self.query_executor_node)
# ... add more nodes and edges

# Wrap with Codon adapter
self._graph = LangGraphWorkloadAdapter.from_langgraph(
    db_agent_graph,
    name="LangGraphSQLAgentDemo",
    version="0.1.0",
    description="A SQL agent created using the LangGraph framework",
    tags=["langgraph", "demo", "sql"],
    compile_kwargs={"checkpointer": MemorySaver()}
)
```

### Automatic Node Inference

The adapter automatically infers nodes from your StateGraph, eliminating the need to manually instrument each node with decorators. This provides comprehensive telemetry out of the box.

**Note:** Only fired nodes are represented in a workload run, so the complete workload definition may not be present in the workload run summary. This is particularly relevant for LangGraph workflows with conditional edges and branching logic—your execution reports will show actual paths taken, not all possible paths.

### Compile Keyword Arguments

You can pass any LangGraph compile arguments through `compile_kwargs`:
- Checkpointers for persistence
- Memory configurations
- Custom compilation options

## Best Practices

1. **Use the adapter**: `LangGraphWorkloadAdapter.from_langgraph()` provides comprehensive instrumentation with just a few lines of code
2. **Initialize telemetry early**: Call `initialize_telemetry()` before creating your workloads
3. **Leverage compile_kwargs**: Pass checkpointers and memory configurations through the adapter
