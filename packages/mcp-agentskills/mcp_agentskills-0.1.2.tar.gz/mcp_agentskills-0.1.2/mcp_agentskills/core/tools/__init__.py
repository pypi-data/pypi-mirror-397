"""Agent operations for using skills.

This module provides operations for using Anthropic's Agent Skills,
including loading skill metadata, reading reference files, and running shell commands.
The classes imported here are registered
as operations in the underlying FlowLLM runtime and are intended to be
referenced via that framework rather than instantiated directly.
