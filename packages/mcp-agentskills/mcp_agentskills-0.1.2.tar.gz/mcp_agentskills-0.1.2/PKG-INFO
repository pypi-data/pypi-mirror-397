              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## 📖 Project Overview

**Agent Skills** is a new function recently introduced by Anthropic. By packaging specialized skills into modular resources, it allows Claude to transform on demand into a “tailored expert” suited to any scenario.
**AgentSkills MCP**, built on the [FlowLLM](https://github.com/flowllm-ai/flowllm) framework, unlocks Claude’s proprietary Agent Skills for any MCP-compatible agent.
It implements the **Progressive Disclosure** architecture proposed in Anthropic’s official [Agent Skills engineering blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills), enabling agents to load necessary skills as needed, thereby efficiently utilizing limited context windows.

### 💡 Why Choose AgentSkills MCP?

- ✅ **Zero-Code Configuration**: one-command install (`pip install mcp-agentskills`)
- ✅ **Out-of-the-Box**: uses official Skill format and fully compatible with [Anthropic’s Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)
- ✅ **MCP Support**: multiple transports (stdio/SSE/HTTP), works with any MCP-compatible agent<!-- - ✅ **Progressive Disclosure**: smart context loading, minimal overhead until skills are needed -->
- ✅ **Flexible Skill Path**: custom skill directories with automatic detection, parsing, and loading

## 🔥 Latest Updates

- [2025-12] 🎉 Released mcp-agentskills v0.1.1

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Install AgentSkills MCP with pip:

```bash
pip install mcp-agentskills
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv pip install mcp-agentskills
```

<details>
<summary><strong>For Development (if you want to modify the code):</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zouyingcao/agentskills-mcp.git
cd agentskills-mcp

conda create -n agentskills-mcp python==3.10
conda activate agentskills-mcp
pip install -e .
```
</details>

---
### Load Skills

1. Create a directory to store Skills, like:

```bash
mkdir skills
```

2. Clone from open-source GitHub repositories, e.g.,

```bash
https://github.com/anthropics/skills
https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills
```

3. Add the collected Skills into the directory created in step 1. Each Skill is a folder containing a SKILL.md file.

---

### Run

<details>
<summary><strong>Local process communication (stdio)</strong></summary>

<p align="left">
  <sub>This mode runs AgentSkills MCP via <code>uvx</code> and communicates through stdin/stdout, suitable for local MCP clients.</sub>
</p>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentskills-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "agentskills-mcp",
        "config=default",
        "mcp.transport=stdio",
        "metadata.skill_dir=\"./skills\""
      ],
      "env": {
        "FLOW_LLM_API_KEY": "xxx",
        "FLOW_LLM_BASE_URL": "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Remote communication (SSE/HTTP Server)</strong></summary>

<p align="left">
  <sub>This mode runs AgentSkills MCP as a standalone SSE/HTTP server that can be accessed remotely.</sub>
</p>

**- Step 1:** Configure Environment Variables

Copy `example.env` to `.env` and fill in your API key:

```bash
cp example.env .env
# Edit the .env file and fill in your API key
```

**- Step 2:** Start the Server

Start the AgentSkills MCP server with SSE transport:

```bash
agentskills-mcp \
  config=default \
  mcp.transport=sse \
  mcp.host=0.0.0.0 \
  mcp.port=8001 \
  metadata.skill_dir="./skills"
```

The service will be available at: `http://0.0.0.0:8001/sse`

**- Step 3:** Connect from MCP Client

  - Add this configuration to your MCP client (Cursor, Gemini Code, Cline, etc.) to connect to the remote SSE server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentskills-mcp": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://0.0.0.0:8001/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

  - You can also use the [FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome) Python client to directly access the server:

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client


async def main():
    async with Client("http://0.0.0.0:8001/sse") as client:
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        for tool in tools:
            print(tool)

        result = await client.call_tool(
            name="load_skill",
            arguments={
              "skill_name"="pdf"
            }
        )
        print(result)


asyncio.run(main())
```

#### One-Command Test

<p align="left">
  <sub>This command will start the server, connect via FastMCP client, and test all available tools automatically.</sub>
</p>

```bash
python tests/run_project_sse.py <path/to/skills>
or
python tests/run_project_http.py <path/to/skills>
```

</details>

### Demo

After starting the AgentSkills MCP server with the SSE transport, you can run the demo:

```bash
# Enable Agent Skills for the Qwen model.
# Since Qwen supports function calling, you can implement Agent Skills by passing the MCP tools registered by the AgentSkills MCP service to the tools parameter.
cd tests
python run_skill_agent.py
```

---
## 🔧 MCP Tools

This service provides four tools to support Agent Skills:
- **load_skill_metadata_op** — Loads the names and descriptions of all Skills into the agent context at startup (always called)
- **load_skill_op** — When a specific skill is needed, loads the SKILL.md content by skill name (invoked when triggering the Skill)
- **read_reference_file_op** — Reads specific files from a skill, such as scripts or reference documents (on demand)
- **run_shell_command_op** — Executes shell commands to run executable scripts included in the skill (on demand)

For detailed parameters and usage examples, see the [documentation](docs/tools.md).
