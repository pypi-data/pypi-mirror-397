## Features

- **Collaborative GIS Environment**: Work together on geographic data projects in real-time.
- **QGIS File Support**: Load, visualize, and manipulate QGIS project files (`.qgs`, `.qgz`), and other GIS data formats.
- **Interactive Maps**: Render interactive maps and geospatial visualizations within Jupyter notebooks using the JupyterGIS Python API.

## [🪄 Try JupyterGIS now! ✨](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lite/lab/index.html?path=france_hiking.jGIS)

This demo runs a JupyterLab instance entirely in your browser with WebAssembly! 🤯

Powered by [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/?badge=latest).
Please note that [JupyterGIS' real-time collaboration features are not yet supported in JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/configure/rtc.html).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- JupyterLab (version 3.0 or higher)
- (OPTIONAL) QGIS installed on your system and its Python modules available in the PATH. e.g. `mamba install --channel conda-forge qgis`

### Installing JupyterGIS

#### From PyPI

```bash
python -m pip install jupytergis
```

#### From conda-forge

JupyterGIS is also packaged and distributed on [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/jupytergis-packages-feedstock).

To install and add JupyterGIS to a project with [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh/), from the project directory run

```
pixi add jupytergis
```

and to install into a particular conda environment with [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/), in the activated environment run

```
mamba install --channel conda-forge jupytergis
```

#### With Docker

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/geojupyter/jupytergis:latest
```

Replace `latest` with a specific version number if you prefer.
Docker build source is at <https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis-docker>.

## Deploying JupyterGIS with JupyterLite

You can run JupyterGIS entirely in the browser using **JupyterLite**.

1. **Create a repository** using the [xeus-lite-demo](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-lite-demo) template.
2. In your fork, edit `environment.yml` and add:
   ```yaml
   - jupytergis-lite
   ```
3. **Add your data and jGIS files** under the `content/` directory of your repository.
   These files will be available directly inside your Lite deployment.
4. **Enable GitHub Pages** under _Settings → Pages_ for your repository.
5. Once the build completes, your Lite deployment will be live at:
   ```
   https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
   ```

This provides a lightweight, fully browser-based JupyterGIS environment — no server required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Collaboration is **not yet supported** in JupyterLite static deployments.
