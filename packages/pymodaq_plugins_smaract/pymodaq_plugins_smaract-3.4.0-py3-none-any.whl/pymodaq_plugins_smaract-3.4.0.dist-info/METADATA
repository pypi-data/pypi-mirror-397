PyMoDAQ plugin for actuators from Smaract (MCS_controller, ...)


Documentation: http://pymodaq.cnrs.fr/

Authors

* David Bresteau (david.bresteau@cea.fr)
* Sebastien J. Weber (sebastien.weber@cnrs.fr)

Instruments
===========
Below is the list of instruments included in this plugin

Actuators
+++++++++

* **SmaractMCS1** SLC linear stages with sensor (S option) with MCS controller
* **SmaractMCS2** positionner with sensor (S option) with MCS2 controller
* **SmaractSCU** SLC linear or angular stages with or without sensors using the Instrumental-lib package and the
  simpler SCU controller

Installation instructions
=========================

Operating system: Windows & Linux.
Python: >=3.9
PyMoDAQ: >=5.0.2

The **MCS1** controller uses python bindings of the Smaract Library as provided by Smaract. It should work directly
after installation of the plugin since the libraries are included. If it is not, try to run the .sh Bash script in the
mcs1 folder (Linux case). Tested on Windows and Ubuntu.

The **MCS2** controller uses python bindings of the Smaract Library as provided by Smaract.
It can seamlessly be used on any platform once you've installed the corresponding SDK (and its \*.dll or \*.so
library).
