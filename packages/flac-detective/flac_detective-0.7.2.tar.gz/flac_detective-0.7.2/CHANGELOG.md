  - Changed from `assets/flac_detective_banner.png` to full GitHub raw URL
  - Ensures proper display on PyPI package page

## [0.7.0] - 2025-12-16

### 🚀 Major Features

#### Partial File Reading (Graceful Degradation)
- **New**: `sf_blocks_partial()` function for reading partial audio data when full decode fails
- **Enhanced**: `AudioCache` now automatically falls back to partial loading on decoder errors
- **Improved**: Analyzer and quality checks now work with partial data
- **Impact**: Problematic but valid FLAC files can now be analyzed instead of being marked as CORRUPTED

#### Energy-Based Cutoff Detection (FIXED)
- **Fixed**: Energy-based cutoff detection now correctly handles bass-heavy music
- **Added**: 15 kHz minimum threshold to distinguish bass concentration from MP3 cutoff
- **Impact**: 
  - False positives reduced by **77%** (198→46 SUSPICIOUS files)
  - Authentic files correctly identified: **+314%** (59→244 AUTHENTIC)
  - Quality score improved: **20.2% → 83.6%** (+312%)
- **Example**: Music with heavy 2-3 kHz bass now correctly identified as AUTHENTIC instead of FAKE

### 🎨 Console Output Improvements
- **Improved**: Removed verbose `logger.warning()` calls from retry mechanism
- **Result**: Clean console output during analysis - only successes and errors shown
- **Preserved**: Debug mode still shows full retry attempt details
- **Impact**: Better UX for batch analysis and production use

### ♻️ Code Quality
- **Cleanup**: Removed 9 temporary debug files from repository
- **Result**: Clean, professional project structure for new contributors

### Changed
- **audio_loader.py**: 
  - Added `sf_blocks_partial()` with retry logic and exponential backoff
  - Converted retry attempt warnings to DEBUG level (lines 43-44, 133-134, 270-271, 359-360)
- **audio_cache.py**: Added partial loading fallback and `is_partial()` tracking method
- **spectrum.py**:
  - Now uses cached audio data directly instead of re-reading from file
  - Added energy-based cutoff fallback when slice-based method fails
  - **NEW**: Added 15 kHz minimum threshold for energy-based cutoff (lines 250-263)
  - Only triggers when cutoff < 85% of Nyquist frequency
- **analyzer.py**: Simplified to use AudioCache's partial handling
- **quality.py**: Skips corruption check when cache is provided, handles partial analysis

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Files with decoder errors no longer falsely marked as CORRUPTED
- **Critical**: Bass-heavy music no longer misidentified as MP3 transodes
- **Example**: "Banda lobourou.flac" (MP3 upscale with decoder errors) now correctly detected as FAKE instead of CORRUPTED
- **Cutoff Detection**: Files with noise in high frequencies now correctly show ~10-16kHz cutoff instead of 22kHz (Nyquist)
- **Console Noise**: Retry attempt warnings no longer spam console output

### Technical Details
- Partial reads collect all successful chunks before decoder error occurs
- Energy-based detection finds where 90% of cumulative energy is reached
- Energy concentration below 15 kHz is now recognized as legitimate audio characteristic (bass) instead of MP3 artifact
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing authentic file detection
- No impact on files without decoder errors

### Performance Impact
- No performance impact for normal files (new code paths only trigger on errors)
- Slight improvement for files with decoder errors (analyzed instead of rejected)
- Console I/O slightly faster due to fewer logging calls

## [0.6.7] - 2025-12-12

### Changed
- **Performance Optimization**: Switched from multi-threading to **multi-processing** (ProcessPoolExecutor).
  - Bypasses Python GIL for true parallel analysis on all CPU cores.
  - Significant speedup on large datasets.
- **Reporting**:
  - Improved console log aesthetics with colored verdicts and aligned columns.
  - Removed unused Excel reporting module (`openpyxl` dependency removed).
  - Removed unused `matplotlib` dependency.
- **Cleanup**: Cleaned up internal threading in spectral analysis to avoid thread over-subscription.

## [0.6.6] - 2025-12-12

### Added
- **Automatic Retry Mechanism for FLAC Decoder Errors**
  - New `audio_loader.py` module with `load_audio_with_retry()` function
  - Automatic retry (max 3 attempts) for temporary decoder errors
  - Exponential backoff: 0.2s → 0.3s → 0.45s between retries
  - Detects temporary errors: "lost sync", "decoder error", "sync error", "invalid frame", "unexpected end"
  - Detailed logging: "⚠️ Temporary error on attempt X", "✅ Audio loaded successfully on attempt X"

### Changed
- **Rule 9 (Compression Artifacts)**
  - Now uses `load_audio_with_retry()` instead of direct `sf.read()`
  - Returns 0 points (no penalty) if loading fails after retries
  - No longer marks files as CORRUPTED on temporary decoder errors
- **Rule 11 (Cassette Detection)**
  - Now uses `load_audio_with_retry()` instead of direct `sf.read()`
  - Returns 0 points (no penalty) if loading fails after retries
  - No longer marks files as CORRUPTED on temporary decoder errors
- **Corruption Detection**
  - `CorruptionDetector` now distinguishes temporary errors from real corruption
  - Temporary decoder errors do NOT mark files as corrupted
  - Adds `partial_analysis: True` flag when optional rules (R9/R11) fail
  - Real corruption (NaN, Inf, unreadable files) still detected immediately

### Fixed
- **Critical: False CORRUPTED status on valid files**
  - Files with temporary "lost sync" errors are no longer marked as corrupted
  - Example: "04 - Bial Hclap; Sagrario - Danza coyote.flac" now analyzed correctly
  - Verdict based on critical rules (R1-R8) even if R9/R11 fail temporarily
- **Improved robustness**
  - Files with prolonged silences or non-standard encoding now analyzed correctly
  - Reduced false positives from temporary decoder synchronization issues

### Technical Details

  - Created: `src/flac_detective/analysis/new_scoring/audio_loader.py`
  - Modified: `src/flac_detective/analysis/new_scoring/artifacts.py`
  - Modified: `src/flac_detective/analysis/new_scoring/rules/cassette.py`

- Documentation:
  - `docs/FLAC_DECODER_ERROR_HANDLING.md` - Technical implementation details
  - `docs/GUIDE_RETRY_MECHANISM.md` - User guide

### Performance Impact
- No impact on files without errors (no retry triggered)
- +0.2s to +1s for files with temporary errors (depending on retry count)
- Maximum +1s overhead for persistent errors (3 retries with backoff)

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-05

### Added
- **Rule 11: Cassette Source Detection**
  - Detects tape hiss, natural roll-off, and cutoff variance
  - Awards 30-65 points for authentic cassette traits
  - **Priority Execution:** Runs before MP3 check and cancels false positive MP3 detections
- **Report Enhancement**: Relative paths in final report
  - Suspicious files now show paths relative to scan root (e.g. `\Album\Song.flac`)
  - Cleaner and more readable output

### Changed
- **Scoring Logic**:
  - Rule 11 runs *before* Rule 1 (MP3 check)
  - If cassette detected (score >= 50), Rule 1 is disabled and a -40pt bonus is applied
  - Fixes false positives where cassette tape noise patterns resembled MP3 artifacts

### Performance
- **Optimization**:
  - Rule 11 only activates for files with cutoff < 19 kHz
  - Integrated into the existing multi-stage optimization pipeline

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-04

### 🎯 Major Achievement
- **79.2% authentic detection rate** on production dataset (759 files)
- **2.2% fake detection rate** with near-zero false positives (< 0.5%)

  - Added 95% Nyquist exception (global)
  - Added 90% Nyquist exception (320 kbps specific)
  - Added variance check (cutoff_std > 100 Hz)
  - Widened 320 kbps container range: (700, 950) → (700, 1050) kbps
- **Rule Execution Order** - R8 now calculated FIRST and applied BEFORE short-circuit
  - Ensures authentic files near Nyquist are protected even if R1-R6 give high scores
  - Prevents false positives from early termination
- **Scoring System** - Refined thresholds
  - FAKE_CERTAIN: ≥ 86 points
  - SUSPICIOUS: 61-85 points
  - WARNING: 31-60 points
  - AUTHENTIC: ≤ 30 points

### Performance Optimizations
- **Phase 1: Smart Short-Circuits** (~70% time reduction)
  - Fast path for authentic files (score < 10, no MP3 detected)
  - Early termination for certain fakes (score ≥ 86 after R1-R6+R8)
- **Phase 2: Progressive Rule 10** (~17% time reduction)
  - Starts with 2 segments, expands to 5 only if needed
- **Phase 3: Parallel Execution** (~6% time reduction)
  - R7 and R9 run in parallel when both are needed
- **File Read Cache** - Avoids multiple reads of the same file
- **Total Performance Gain: ~80%** (10 hours → 1h45 for 759 files)

### Fixed
- **Critical: Short-circuit bug** - R8 was not applied before early termination
- **False positives on 21 kHz cutoff** - Files with cutoff at 95% Nyquist incorrectly flagged as MP3 320k
- **False positives on 20.2-20.8 kHz** - Zone between 90-95% Nyquist now protected for 320k detection
- **Vinyl rips misdetection** - R7 Phase 2 & 3 now correctly identify authentic vinyl sources
