# fustor-cli

This package provides the unified Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing and interacting with various Fustor services within the monorepo. Built with `click`, it consolidates the CLIs of `fustor-registry`, `fustor-fusion`, and `fustor-agent` into a single entry point.

## Features

*   **Unified Interface**: Access commands for `registry`, `fusion`, and `agent` services from a single `fustor` command.
*   **Extensible**: Designed to easily integrate new service CLIs as the Fustor ecosystem grows.
*   **User-Friendly**: Leverages `click` for intuitive command-line argument parsing and help messages.

## Installation

This package is part of the Fustor monorepo and is typically installed in editable mode within the monorepo's development environment using `uv sync`. Once installed, the `fustor` command will be available in your shell.

## Usage

The `fustor` command acts as a dispatcher for subcommands related to each Fustor service.
