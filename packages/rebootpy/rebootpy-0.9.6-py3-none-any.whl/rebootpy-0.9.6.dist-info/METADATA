Asynchronous library for interacting with Fortnite and EpicGames' API and XMPP services.

This library is a fork of [Terbau](https://github.com/Terbau/)'s [fortnitepy](https://github.com/Terbau/fortnitepy) which was abandoned.<br>
If you want to check out the original commit history, you can view it [here](https://github.com/Terbau/fortnitepy/commits/master/).

**Note:** This library is still under development so breaking changes might happen at any time.

**Some key features:**
- Full support for Friends.
- Support for XMPP events.
- Support for Parties.
- Support for Battle Royale stats.
- ~~Support for friend & party messages.~~ (currently broken on all libraries due to signing algorithm not being reversed yet)

# Authorization Code
How to get a one time authorization code:
1. Log into the epic games account of your choice [here](https://www.epicgames.com/id/login?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epicgames.com%2Fid%2Fapi%2Fredirect%3FclientId%3D3f69e56c7649492c8cc29f1af08a8a12%26responseType%3Dcode).
2. Copy the value of the `authorizationCode` field from the response as shown in the image below:

![Authorization Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMistt/rebootpy/main/docs/resources/images/authorization_code.png)

Keep in mind that authorization code isn't the only method of authentication, you can view all of them [here](https://rebootpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#authentication), DeviceAuth is recommended once you've generated device auths.
