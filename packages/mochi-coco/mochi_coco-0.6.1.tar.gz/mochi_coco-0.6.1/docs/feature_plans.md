# Feature Plans

- [x] stream the response normal and then render markdown only after the final chunk
- [x] Render user input in markdown, after user presses enter
- [x] add model name to each message object
- [x] add id to each message object (`message_id`)
- [x] customize the markdown rendering (headers)
- [x] within chat session open session menu to choose chats with `/chats`
- [x] add eval_count and prompt_eval_count to assistant message
- [x] when enable or disable markdown rendering during chat, the chat history should be cleared and re-rendered
- [x] multiline input for user
- [x] delete command for chat session menu
- [x] when user wants to creat new chat and quits models seleciton, they should return to the chat sessions menu
- [x] change approach of commands during chat session to have one command (`/menu`) which opens a menu where the user can select from the available options.
  - Available options:
    - `chats`: Open chat session menu and select a chat session to continue with
    - `models`: Choose LLM to continue with for the chat session
    - `markdown`: Toggle markdown rendering during chat
    - `thinking`: Toggle thinking rendering during chat
  - This feature does not affect `/edit` command.
- [x] workflow: during session, within breaks a LLM is requested to create a chat session summary. This could be used for the @chat workflow, so an LLM would be better in finding other chat sessions for the user request.
- [x] break llm response with "ESC" and store partial response in chat history
- [x] Give user possibility to change a specific user prompt and continue from this message again (see `manual_testing/edit_message.md`) while old messages will be deleted from the chat history
- [x] only list ollama models with `completion` functionality (see `OllamaClient().show(model).capabilities`)
- [x] add info to model overview if a model can use tools
- [x] add system prompt
- [x] Add tool usage
- [x] add folder with example tools users of the application can use to get started and to showcase the capabilities of the application + add documentation on how to create own tools
- [x] show tool on/off, tool policy and enabled tools in session info (when loaded and created)
- [x] remove logic for maximum tool usage
- [x] when starting mochi-coco show version
- [x] make sure after editing a message and starting from there, that the 'Assistant' Panel is correctly rendered (it's missing the borders)
- [x] add possibility to stop stream/generation from ollama server
- [x] set context window by user and show in status
- [ ] add host url to "Chat Session" panel
- [x] command `mochi-coco --chat 1` to open last chat session directly from start
- [x] add chat session summary to session tile
- [x] command `/status` within chat to see the chat status showing: session id, context used vs context window, llms used --> like when a chat is starting (just showing this information)
- [ ] autocomplete with file names when user inserts @ to add files to message context
  - needs: search for files in the directory of the terminal
  - needs: activate autocomplete for file names when user types @ (see nested completer: https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.52/pages/asking_for_input.html#nested-completion)
  - needs: consider .gitignore to exclude these files
  - needs: complete while typing (see prompt toolkit documtation: https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.52/pages/asking_for_input.html#autocompletion)
  - needs: functionality to add files to message context (insert in user message thoughtfully)
- [ ] toogle to exclude thinking block in chat history from new requests (will reduce tokens)
- [ ] autocomplete for commands during chat sessions
- [ ] add possibility to go into "agent mode" to have a more agent like behavior of the LLM and not stopping the requests to the ollama server when the LLM is responding in text instead of tools.
  - [ ] experiment with using the summary LLM decide after each normal response if the LLM should proceed or stop.

# Issues

- [ ] stream stops after a while and the complete output get displayed when LLM has finished (but should continuously stream)

# Open Questions

- how could adding an image to the user input be done?

# Feature Drafts

## Workflows with enhanced chat session structure

The LLM can choose workflows. Workflows in a chat session are performed with a sub-chat session. The sub-chat session message history is stored in the same chat session json file but uses a sub object `workflows` which contains for each workflow an array of message objects.
The reference to a message object from the origin chat history is given by the `message_id` field.

In winter, canned crushed tomatoes work well. |\n| **Add sausage** | Cook sliced Turkish sausage (sucuk) in the skillet first, then add the veggies. |\n| **Try different peppers** | Red, yellow, or green peppers yield varied colors and flavors. |\n| **Make it vegan** | Substitute eggs with chickpea flour batter or tofu scramble for a plant‑based version. |\n| **Spice it up** | Use cayenne or harissa for a fiery kick. |\n| **Serve on a plate** | Menemen is traditionally eaten from a shallow plate or skillet; keep it that way for authenticity! |\n\n---\n\n## Nutritional Snapshot (approx. per serving, 2 eggs)\n\n- Calories: 260 kcal  \n- Protein: 18 g  \n- Fat: 18 g  \n- Carbohydrates: 12 g  \n- Fiber: 3 g\n\n*(Values vary with ingredient choices and portion size.)*\n\nEnjoy this quick, comforting dish that captures the heart of Turkish home cooking!",
