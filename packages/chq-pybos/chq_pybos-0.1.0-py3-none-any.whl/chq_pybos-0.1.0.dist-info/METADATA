# Python BOS

A Python client library for the BOS API with improved developer ergonomics and type safety.

## Important Note

The BOS API is covered under an NDA signed by a Chautauqua Officer. The NDA may, by extension, cover this library. Its use should be limited to those covered under the NDA, namely CHQ employees.

## Recent Improvements

### Enhanced Developer Experience

The library has been significantly improved with structured data types that replace tuple-based parameters, providing:

- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error detection and IDE validation
- **Self-Documenting API**: Clear field names and structured parameters
- **IDE Support**: Autocomplete, type hints, and go-to-definition

### Example: Account Service Improvements

**Old Approach (deprecated):**
```python
# Unclear tuple structure - what do these numbers mean?
filter_list = [(1, "john@example.com", 1)]
result = service.search_account(filter_list=filter_list)
```

**New Approach (recommended):**
```python
from pybos.types import AccountFilter, SearchType

# Clear, type-safe structure
filter_obj = AccountFilter(
    object_type=1,
    value="john@example.com", 
    search_type=SearchType.EQUAL
)
result = service.search_account(filters=[filter_obj], active_only=True)
```

**Complex Operations (using request objects):**
```python
from pybos.types import SearchAccountRequest, AccountFilter, SearchType

# For complex operations, create request objects directly
search_request = SearchAccountRequest(
    filters=[
        AccountFilter(1, "john@example.com", SearchType.EQUAL),
        AccountFilter(2, "Smith", SearchType.LIKE)
    ],
    active_only=True,
    dmg_category_list=["cat1", "cat2"]
)

result = service.search_account(**search_request.__dict__)
```

## Installing

The Python BOS library can be installed through pip or pipenv using the git repository as a source. A read-only access token has been created to facilitate http access to the repository. This token and link should not be shared publicly.

### Main Branch (Major Releases):

```
pipenv install git+https://oauth2:glpat-bHSfMffW14FbYDWFuyzs@gitlab.it.chq.org/IT/pybos.git@main#egg=pybos
```

Version specific tagging (corresponding to BOS versions) to be implemented at a later date.


## BOS API Details

The BOS API is a SOAP API that provides WSDL information in XML file that denotes the structure of the requests and responses it expects as well as what operations are available.
