This module is used to store a dictionary that maps subcommand names to their corresponding dataclass types.

Other packages or subpackages can register their subcommands by adding entries to this dictionary, such as
```
from qmp.utility.subcommand_dict import subcommand_dict
subcommand_dict["my_subcommand"] = MySubcommand
```
