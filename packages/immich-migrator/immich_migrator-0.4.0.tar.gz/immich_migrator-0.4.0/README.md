Migrate your photo library between **Immich** servers with confidence.

This CLI tool downloads albums 📥, preserves EXIF metadata 📝, and uploads to your new server 📤 — all with **interactive selection 🎯, progress tracking 📊, and state persistence 💾** for reliable migrations.

---

## 📦 Installation

> [!TIP]
> Use **uvx** to run the tool instantly without installation — perfect for one-time migrations:
>
> ```bash
> uvx immich-migrator main
> ```

### Install with uv (persistent)

```bash
uv tool install immich-migrator
```

### Traditional pip install

```bash
pip install immich-migrator
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kallegrens/immich-migrator.git
cd immich-migrator
uv sync
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Python**: 3.11 or higher ✅
- **Disk Space**: At least 5GB free for temporary storage 💾
- **ExifTool**: For EXIF metadata handling 📝

  ```bash
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl

  # macOS
  brew install exiftool
  ```

### 1. Prepare a unified credentials file

The tool expects a single credentials file containing both old and new server details. By default, it looks for `~/.immich.env`.

Create `~/.immich.env` (or copy from `.immich.env.example`):

```bash
# ~/.immich.env
# OLD server
OLD_IMMICH_SERVER_URL=https://old.immich.example.com
OLD_IMMICH_API_KEY=your-old-server-api-key-here

# NEW server
NEW_IMMICH_SERVER_URL=https://new.immich.example.com
NEW_IMMICH_API_KEY=your-new-server-api-key-here
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can provide an explicit path with `--credentials` (or `-c`). When specified, the default `~/.immich.env` lookup is skipped.

### 2. Run migration

Run with the default credentials file (`~/.immich.env`):

```bash
uv run immich-migrator main
```

Or specify a custom credentials path:

```bash
uv run immich-migrator main -c /path/to/your/credentials.env
```

**What happens next?** 🎬

1. 🔍 Connects to your old Immich server
2. 📚 Discovers all albums (including unalbummed assets)
3. 🎯 Displays an interactive menu for album selection
4. ⬇️ Downloads selected albums with progress tracking
5. ⬆️ Uploads to the new server with album organization intact
6. 💾 Saves state for resume capability

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Migration

```bash
uv run immich-migrator main
```

### Custom Batch Size

```bash
uv run immich-migrator main --batch-size 30
```

### Custom Configuration

```bash
uv run immich-migrator main --config config.toml
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
uv run immich-migrator main --log-level DEBUG
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `config.toml` file for advanced configuration:

```toml
[migration]
batch_size = 25
max_concurrent_downloads = 5
rate_limit_rps = 10.0
download_timeout_seconds = 300

[storage]
state_file = "~/.immich-migrator/state.json"
temp_dir = "~/.immich-migrator/temp"

[logging]
level = "INFO"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### 🔐 Authentication Errors

> [!WARNING]
> If you encounter authentication errors:
>
> - ✅ Verify your API key is correct and has not expired
> - ✅ Check that the server URL is accessible (include https://)
> - ✅ Ensure you have the necessary permissions on both servers

### 💾 Storage Errors

> [!NOTE]
> If you see insufficient storage errors:
>
> - Reduce batch size: `--batch-size 10`
> - Specify a different temp directory: `--temp-dir /path/to/large/disk`
> - Free up disk space before retrying

### 🌐 Network Errors

The tool automatically retries failed downloads with exponential backoff.

> [!TIP]
> If errors persist:
>
> - Check your network connection stability
> - Verify both servers are accessible from your location
> - Try reducing `max_concurrent_downloads` in `config.toml`
> - Use `--log-level DEBUG` to see detailed error messages
