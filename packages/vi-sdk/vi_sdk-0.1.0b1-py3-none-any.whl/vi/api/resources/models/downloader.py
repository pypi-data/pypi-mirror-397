        """Download and extract a fine-tuned model from a training run.

        Downloads a model archive, extracts it, and returns paths to the model
        components. If the model already exists and overwrite=False, returns
        existing paths without re-downloading. Supports resumable downloads
        for large model files.

        Args:
            run_id: Unique identifier of the training run that produced the model.
            download_url: Pre-signed URL to download the model archive from.
            save_dir: Base directory where models are saved. The model will be

            - run_config_path: JSON file with training configuration and metadata

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the downloaded archive doesn't contain required model files
                or if extraction fails.
            PermissionError: If unable to write to the save directory.
            OSError: If insufficient disk space or network issues occur.

        Example:
            ```python
            from vi.api.resources.models.downloader import ModelDownloader
            from pathlib import Path

            # Create downloader with progress display
