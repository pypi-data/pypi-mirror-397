    """Base class for resource downloaders with parallel download and resume support.

    This abstract class provides robust downloading capabilities including:
    - Parallel chunk-based downloads for optimal performance
    - Automatic resume support using manifest files for interrupted downloads
    - CRC32C checksum verification for data integrity
    - Adaptive connection management based on file size
    - Progress tracking with detailed status updates

    The downloader automatically splits large files into chunks and downloads them
    in parallel using multiple workers. If a download is interrupted, it can resume
    from the last completed chunk without re-downloading already completed portions.

    Attributes:
        _show_progress: Whether to display progress bars during downloads.
        _overwrite: Whether to overwrite existing files.
        _max_workers: Maximum number of parallel download workers (auto-scaled based on CPU).
        _http_client: Configured HTTP client for download operations with connection pooling.
