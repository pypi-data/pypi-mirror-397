repomap
=======

This project contains code derived from aider (https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)

Copyright 2023-2024 Paul Gauthier and aider contributors
Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0

The original repomap implementation in aider provided the foundation for
the tree-sitter based repository mapping, PageRank ranking algorithm,
and TreeContext formatting used in this project.

Modifications made:
- Extracted core logic into standalone package
- Removed aider-specific IO and LLM dependencies
- Added CLI with --exclude and --language filtering options
- Adapted to tree-sitter 0.25.2 QueryCursor API
