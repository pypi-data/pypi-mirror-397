# Intel(R) CPU Runtime for OpenCL(TM) Applications Configuration file
# =======================================================================
#
# Notes:
# -----------
#
# Configurable runtime variables can be loaded from cl.cfg and corresponding
# environment variables. If the environment variables are set, they will override
# the values from cl.cfg. Note that CL_CONFIG_TBB_VERSION and CL_CONFIG_TBB_DLL_PATH
# can only be loaded from cl.cfg. For size specifications with units, the accepted
# units are: "GB", "G", "MB", "M", "KB", "K", "B" and their lowercase equivalents.
# The available runtime variables are listed below:
#
# CL_CONFIG_LOG_FILE [string] -
#       Set path of the log file.
#
# CL_CONFIG_DUMP_BIN [bool] -
#       Control whether object binary of OpenCL program is dumped. Destination
#       is the current directory.
#
# CL_CONFIG_DUMP_DISASSEMBLY [bool] -
#       Control whether disassembled assembly of OpenCL program is dumped.
#       Destination is the current directory.
#
# CL_CONFIG_USE_ITT_API [bool] -
#       Determine whether GPA/ITT traces collection is active or not.
#
# CL_CONFIG_USE_VECTORIZER [bool] -
#       Determine whether auto-vectorization module is active or not.
#
# CL_CONFIG_USE_VTUNE [bool] -
#       Determine whether VTune AmplifierXE instrumentation is active or not.
#
# CL_CONFIG_USE_TRAPPING [bool] -
#       Determine whether CPU workers trapping is active or not.
#
# CL_CONFIG_USE_FAST_RELAXED_MATH [bool] -
#       Determine whether build kernels with -cl-fast-relaxed-math option.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_MAX_WORK_GROUP_SIZE [size] -
#       Force CPU to work with specified maximum work-group size. Out of bounds
#       values are clamped to [8192, 67108864].
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_WORK_GROUP_SIZE [size or array of size] -
#       examples: export CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_WORK_GROUP_SIZE=128
#                 export CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_WORK_GROUP_SIZE=128,1,1
#       Force CPU to work with specified workgroup size. If this env is set,
#       local_work_size of clEnqueueNDRangeKernel is ignored.
#       NOTE: If array size is larger than work_dim of clEnqueueNDRangeKernel,
#             only the first work_dim values of the array are used.
#             If array size is smaller than work_dim, workgroup size of higher
#             dim will be set to 1.
#       clEnqueueNDRangeKernel returns CL_INVALID_WORK_GROUP_SIZE if
#       * any of the first work_dim values is negative.
#       * or any of the first work_dim values is larger than global_work_size.
#       * or maximum of the first work_dim values is larger than query result of
#         CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_GROUP_SIZE.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_GLOBAL_MEM_SIZE [size with units] -
#       examples: 2GB, 512MB, 65536KB, 16777216B
#       Force CPU to work with specified global memory size, this will also affect
#       max memory allocation size unless CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_MAX_MEM_ALLOC_SIZE is
#       used too.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_MAX_MEM_ALLOC_SIZE [size with units] -
#       examples: 2GB, 512MB, 65536KB, 16777216B
#       Force CPU to work with specified max memory allocation size.

#       examples: 8MB, 256KB (default), 8388608B
#       Force CL_DEVICE_LOCAL_MEM_SIZE for CPU device to be the given value.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_VECTORIZER_MODE [mode] -
#       Control vectorization mode of the CPU compiler. Applies only then
#       CL_CONFIG_USE_VECTORIZER = True.
#       0: (default) Automonous vectorization. The compiler makes heuristic decisions
#          whether to vectorize each kernel, and if so to what vector length.
#       1: No compiler vectorization. Explicit kernel vector data types are left intact.
#          The same as if CL_CONFIG_USE_VECTORIZER = False.
#       [4, 8, 16, 32, 64]: Disable heuristic and force vectorization to the specified length.
#       NOTE: Some kernels do not support vectorization from functional aspect.
#       Such kernels cannot be vectorized in any mode.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_RT_LOOP_UNROLL_FACTOR [factor] -
#       Control loop unrolling of loops with non-constant trip count. Out of bounds
#       values are clamped to [1, 16].
#       examples: 1, 2, 3, 16
#       1: no RT unrolling (default)
#       [2, 16]: unrolling factor
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_TBB_NUM_WORKERS [unsigned number] -
#       Control the number of TBB workers/threads. Work-groups can be executed
#       parallelly by CL_CONFIG_CPU_TBB_NUM_WORKERS threads.
#       Out of bounds values are clamped to [1, MAX_NUM].
#       cpu device: MAX_NUM is the number of logical CPU cores. Default value is MAX_NUM.
#       NOTE: If CL_CONFIG_CPU_TBB_NUM_WORKERS is 1, work-groups are executed
#       sequentially by a single thread.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_TARGET_ARCH [cpu target arch] -
#       Generate code exclusively for a given target CPU architecture.
#       examples: graniterapids, sapphirerapids, icelake-client, icelake-server,
#       cascadelake, skx, core-avx2, corei7-avx, corei7.
#
# CL_CONFIG_STACK_DEFAULT_SIZE [size with units] -
#       examples: 4MB, 8MB (default), 16MB
#       This value is the default stack size for kernel execution.
#       If actual stack size is greater than this value, stack reallocation will occur.
#
# CL_CONFIG_STACK_EXTRA_SIZE [size with units] -
#       examples: 512KB, 1MB (default), 2MB
#       This value is the extra stack size for execution of builtin and third-party functions.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_STREAMING_ALWAYS [bool] -
#       Determine whether Non-Temporal instructions are used or not.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_EXPENSIVE_MEM_OPT [unsigned number] -
#       examples: 0 (default), 0x0001
#       A bitmap indicating enabled expensive memory optimizations. These
#       optimizations may lead to more JIT compilation time, but give some
#       performance benefit.
#       Available bits:
#       0: OpenCL address space alias analysis
#
# CL_CONFIG_ENABLE_PARALLEL_COPY [bool] -
#       True: (default) parallel copy/fill is enabled. Memory copy/fill in
#             clEnqueueReadBuffer, clEnqueueWriteBuffer, clEnqueueCopyBuffer,
#             clEnqueueSVMMemcpy, clEnqueueMemcpyINTEL, clEnqueueSVMMemFill,
#             clEnqueueMemsetINTEL and clEnqueueMemFillINTEL is executed
#             parallelly using internal kernels.
#       False: parallel copy/fill is disabled.
#
# CL_CONFIG_TBB_VERSION [string] -
#       Define the TBB version used by task executor.
#       The full tbb library path is recorded in Windows registry key
#       under the location with this version number. It should be updated
#       when TBB library is uplifted to a new version.
#
# CL_CONFIG_TBB_DLL_PATH [string] -
#       Define the TBB DLL PATH used by task executor.
#       As a solution for Conda release channel. The tbb dll full path can be
