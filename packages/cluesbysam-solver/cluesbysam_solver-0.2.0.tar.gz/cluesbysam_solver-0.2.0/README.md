# 'Clues by Sam' Solver

This project provides a thin wrapper around the [Z3 SMT solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_Theorem_Prover) to assist in solving ['Clues by Sam' puzzles](https://cluesbysam.com). Of course the whole point of such puzzles is to solve them manually, but it seemed like a nice problem to apply Z3 to. In the end the majority of this project focusses on providing an ergonomic API; the actual Z3 complexity is very low. It turns out finding a way to formalize Sam's clues can be quite fun in and of itself!

## Installation

Ensure you have Z3 installed, e.g. by following the instructions in the [Z3 repository](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). This package depends on the Z3 Python bindings, available on PyPI as [`z3-solver`](https://pypi.org/project/z3-solver/).

Then, install this package using your favorite Python package management frontend, for example:

```
pip install cluesbysam-solver
```

## Usage example

This section describes a fictional 3x3 puzzle; I wouldn't want to give away the solution to any of Sam's puzzles! You can also directly read the code for the below example without intermittent explanation at [example.py](example.py).

First we define a grid of people for our puzzle:

```python
grid = (
    ('Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol'),
    ('Dave', 'Eve', 'Frank'),
    ('Grace', 'Heidi', 'Ivan'),
)
```

Then we initialize the solver:

```python
from cluesbysam_solver import ClueSolver

cs = ClueSolver(grid)
```

The primary function we'll be using is `ClueSolver.add`, to add the clues as assertions for z3.

Let's assume Frank is revealed initially to be *Innocent*, providing the following clue: *"Carol is one of my 3 criminal neighbors"*. We formalize this as follows:

```python
from cluesbysam_solver import INNOCENT, CRIMINAL

p = cs.people
cs.add(p['Frank'] == INNOCENT)

# <Frank> Carol is one of my 3 criminal neighbors
cs.add(p['Carol'] == CRIMINAL)
cs.add(cs.num_criminals(cs.neighbors("Frank")) == 3)
```

This gives us the following output, revealing Carol's role (perhaps unsurprisingly):

```
... Adding clue:
Frank == 0
[+] Frank must be:      Innocent

... Adding clue:
Carol == 1
[+] Carol must be:      Criminal

... Adding clue:
0 + Heidi + Bob + Eve + Ivan + Carol == 3
[!] No new information
```

Now, let's assume Carol gives us the clue that *"Alice only shares innocent neighbors with Grace*." We first get the shared neighbors by computing the intersection of their neighbors, and then assert that they must all be innocent.

```python
# <Carol> Alice only shares innocent neighbors with Grace
shared_neighbors = cs.neighbors("Alice") & cs.neighbors("Grace")
cs.add(cs.num_innocents(shared_neighbors) == len(shared_neighbors))
```

This gives us Dave and Eve;

```
... Adding clue:
2 - (0 + Dave + Eve) == 2
[+] Dave must be:       Innocent
[+] Eve must be:        Innocent
```

Dave says that *"The criminals in row 1 are connected."* There's a convenient function to express exactly that; by specifying the expected role and a sequence of people, we get an assertion to add.

```python
# <Dave> The criminals in row 1 are connected
cs.add(cs.connected(CRIMINAL, cs.row(1)))
```

Unfortunately, it does not immediately lead to much..

```
... Adding clue:
And(Not(And(Bob == 0, 0 + Alice > 0, 0 + Carol > 0)),
    Not(And(Alice == 0, False, 0 + Bob + Carol > 0)),
    Not(And(Carol == 0, 0 + Bob + Alice > 0, False)))
[!] No new information
```

We still have Eve, though, who tells us that *"There are exactly 2 innocents in column C."* Using `ClueSolver.column(a: str)` and `ClueSolver.row(i: int)`, we can quickly get the people in a column or row by specifying a column letter or row number.

```python
# <Eve> There are exactly 2 innocents in column C
cs.add(cs.num_innocents(cs.column("C")) == 2)
```

A throve of information!

```
... Adding clue:
3 - (0 + Frank + Ivan + Carol) == 2
[+] Bob must be:        Criminal
[+] Heidi must be:      Criminal
[+] Ivan must be:       Innocent
```

Heidi's clue is *"Only one row has exactly 2 innocents."* That's somewhat tricky to express, but we can always rely on native Z3 functions for more complex statements. In this case, we use `AtMost` and `AtLeast` to specify that the statement ('[..] has exactly 2 innocents') pertains to a single row, without having to define which one.

You can import `AtMost` and `AtLeast` (as well as functions such as `Or` and `Implies`) directly from Z3, but `cluesbysam_solver` also exposes them. In this case we could have added both assertions at once using `And`, but can also specify them separately.

```python
# <Heidi> Only one row has exactly 2 innocents
from cluesbysam_solver import AtMost, AtLeast

cs.add(AtMost(*(cs.num_innocents(cs.row(i)) == 2 for i in range(1, 4)), 1))
cs.add(AtLeast(*(cs.num_innocents(cs.row(i)) == 2 for i in range(1, 4)), 1))
```

This gives us the following.

```
... Adding clue:
AtMost((3 - (0 + Bob + Alice + Carol) == 2,
        3 - (0 + Dave + Eve + Frank) == 2,
        3 - (0 + Grace + Ivan + Heidi) == 2),
       1)
[!] No new information

... Adding clue:
AtLeast((3 - (0 + Bob + Alice + Carol) == 2,
         3 - (0 + Dave + Eve + Frank) == 2,
         3 - (0 + Grace + Ivan + Heidi) == 2),
        1)
[+] Grace must be:      Innocent
```


Ivan tells us *"The number of criminals in the corners is even"*. Z3 does not have an `Even` and `Odd` function, but as clues involving odd and even numbers are quite common, `ClueSolver` provides them.

```python
# <Ivan> The number of criminals in the corners is even
from cluesbysam_solver import Even

cs.add(Even(cs.num_criminals(cs.corners())))
```

And that concludes this example!

```
... Adding clue:
Exists(x!8, 0 + Grace + Alice + Ivan + Carol == 2*x!8)
[+] Alice must be:      Criminal

Puzzle complete! All roles have been identified!
```

Other functions that this example did not cover are `above(person)`, `below(person)`, `left_of(person)` and `right_of(person)`, doing as their name suggests, as well as `edges()` to retrieve the people on the edges.
