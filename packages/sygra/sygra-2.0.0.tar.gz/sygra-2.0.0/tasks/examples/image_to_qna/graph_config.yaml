                You are a helpful assistant who should be grounded in the provided documents and generate questions based on them.

                You are tasked with generating challenging, high-quality questions that require deep reading comprehension and critical thinking over the provided documents.
            
                Requirements:
                - Please output exactly 3 questions
                - Each question must require synthesis, inference, or reasoning across multiple parts of one or more documents.
                - Avoid simple fact recall or surface-level questions.
                - All questions must be answerable strictly and solely from the information in the provided documents. Do not use outside knowledge or make assumptions.
                - For each question, briefly indicate which part(s) of the documents support the answer.
                - Ensure that all 3 questions are distinct and cover different aspects or require different reasoning steps.
                - A question can be lengthy and does not have to be restricted to a single sentence or be curt.
                - The questions should be a mix of how, why, how many, what, who, when, etc. You should also think of more varieties.
                - You should have at least 1 objective question which requires an objective specific answer (e.g., named entities, a number that could be extracted or derived, etc.) and at least 1 subjective question which requires analytical thinking and reasoning. Annotate your question as being objective/subjective
            
                Examples:
                - ❌ Not acceptable: 'What is the capital of France?' (simple fact recall)
                - ✅ Acceptable: 'Based on the arguments presented in both Document 1 and Document 2, how did the author’s perspective on urban development evolve, and what evidence supports this change?'
            
                If you are provided multiple documents, generate questions that require integrating information across them.
            
            
                DOCUMENTS:

                ---
                Output Format Instructions:
                Please output the questions in the following format for easy parsing:
                
                <question1>
