'''
Array Storage API abstraction

This is meant to implement the operations that CAmagick supports in
an backend-agnostic way. Typically, CAmagick writes to HDF5, Zarr
and Tiled. So this API intents to support the common denominator of
all of these:

- Eternal / internal path (i.e. an entry point, "file" or "url"
  that designates a high-level resource, and an internal path
  that designates a low-level resource within the high-level
  one)

- Groups or Datasets (HDF5-like hiearchical structure, where
  there are datasets or groups, with the groups containing further
  datasets or subgroups, accessible by ["...path..."])

- Datasets can be sliced, and meta information (in particular data type
  and shape) can be accessed by `.dtype`, respectively `.shape`

- Datasets and/or groups can have attributes by means of `.attrs[...]`

- Files can be opened for reading, or for read-writing, optionally
  overwriting or refusing to create new files when opening for
  read-writing and the file already exists / doesn't exist.

    This is just to document the abstract API.

    The API elements are heavily tailored towards CAmagick's needs, which
    are essentially appending new data ("frames") to existing datasets.
    To implement a new backend, at least the following members need
    to be defined:

    - Store opening: `_open_writable()`
    - Dataset management: `_ensure_dataset_base()`, `_ensure_dataset()`

    Additonally, possibly:
    - Read-only access: `_open_readable()` if different from read-write access
    - Store closing: `_close()`, if the store object doesn't support `.close()`    
    - Dataset sizing: `._resize_dataset()` (and possibly `_reset_dataset()`),
      if the dataset doesn't have a `.resize(shape)` function.

    def __init__(self, store=None, sdir=None, mode=None, **tags):
        '''
        Initializes the storage mechanism.

        This is typically created by higher layers, once per session (i.e.
        read/write loop run). Saving to multiple locations (i.e. store "files"
        paths within files) is supported by virtue of appropriate combination
        of `sdir` and/or `**tags` parameters. The actual storage backend objects
        are created lazily, during async enter/exit environments. This makes it
        possible to use formatting spec `{...}` in the storage paths, and
        set those paths at a later time using format keys.
        
        
        Args:
            store: Top-level store path (file name or URL). May contain
              formatting values `{...}`, which are evaluated later at
              `.push_frame()` time.

            sdir: Path inside the store. If this is not `None`, it is
              prepended to any of the tags logation from `tags`. It is
              intended to make it easy to specify a top-level directory,
              or to make a one-size-fits-all path spec for all tags.
              May contain formatting values `{...}`, which are evaluated
              at `.push_frame()` time.

            mode: What to do when we're required to create or overwrite a
              data point. We only concert ourselves with data points since
              this is what CAmagick's basic data currency is. For everything
              else (files, groups), the policy follows whatever must be done
              to ensure the data point mode policy can be followed.
        
              This must be either `None`, or a string consistinc or a
              combination of `a` (append), `o` or `O` (overwrite)
              or `x` (reset), possibly in combination with `+` (top-up),
              meaning:
        
                 - `a`: require that the data point be always appended
                   to the current dataset -- never overwrite or delete
                   existing data.
        
                 - `o`: overwrite already existing data points (frames).
                   If the shape of the new data point frames doesn't match
                   the old ones, then fail.

                 - `O`: same as `o`, but additioally delete and re-create
                   whole dataset entries, if the shape or data type of the
                   existing dataset does not match the new request.

                 - `x`: reset the entire dataset (i.e. delete all existing
                   data points) if a data point already exists at the
                   specified index.

                 - `+`: top-up marker will fill up empty slots, but without
                    actually writing any data to them. They will remain
                    filled with default settings of the corresponding backend
                    and the data type. If top-up is not specified, otherwise
                    the operation will fail if index is higher than the one of
                    the next slot in turn.

              If `mode` is set to `None`, each dataset, and consequently the
              whole store, is opened for reading only. This also reflects
              the behavior of the async environment enter/exit functionality.

            **tags: Keys are tag names (by which to refer the data in
              `.push_frame()`, and values are path elements, for each
              frame in itself. If the values are `None`, the value of `sdir`
              is used. Otherwise the value of `sdir` (if itself not `None`)
              is prepended to the path values.
