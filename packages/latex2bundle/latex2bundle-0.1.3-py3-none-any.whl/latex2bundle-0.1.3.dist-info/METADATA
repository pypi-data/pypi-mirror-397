# LaTeX2Bundle

![LaTeX2Bundle banner](assets/banner.svg)

**LaTeX2Bundle** packages a LaTeX project into a single ZIP archive.
It resolves `\\input{}` and `\\include{}`, collects figures and auxiliary files (e.g. `.bib`, `.cls`), optionally reduces bibliographies to cited entries, and produces a ready-to-share bundle.

---

## Features

* Resolves `\\input{}` and `\\include{}` directives
* Copies figures and auxiliary files into a self-contained directory
* Optionally reduces `.bib` files to only cited entries
* Optionally renames figures for portability
* Produces a single ZIP archive

---

## Usage

```bash
latex2bundle path/to/main.tex [options]
```

### Options

* `-c, --copy-files <files...>`
  Include additional files (e.g. `extra.bib myclass.cls`)

* `-t, --target-dir <dir>`
  Output directory (defaults to the main file’s directory)

  Verbose logging

* `--no-reduce-bib`
  Keep full `.bib` files (disable citation-based reduction)

* `--no-rename-figures`
  Keep original figure filenames

---

## Examples

```bash
# Basic: bundle main.tex into ./bundle and create main.zip
latex2bundle path/to/main.tex

### Mode examples

The `--mode` flag controls what artifacts are produced. Valid values:

- `both` (default): create the cleaned bundle directory and a ZIP archive containing it.
- `zip-only`: create only the ZIP archive and remove the temporary bundle directory.
- `bundle-only`: create and keep the bundle directory but do not create a ZIP file.

Examples:

```bash
# Create both the bundle and the ZIP (default)
latex2bundle path/to/main.tex --mode both

# Produce only the ZIP and remove the bundle directory
latex2bundle path/to/main.tex --mode zip-only

# Produce only the bundle directory without creating a ZIP
latex2bundle path/to/main.tex --mode bundle-only
```

---

## Combine .bib files

Use the included tool to scan one or more TeX entry files, collect all referenced `.bib` files (recursing through `\input`/`\include`), and produce a single combined `.bib` containing only the cited entries. The tool also detects conflicting keys and can print sorted entries.

Basic usage:

```bash
# scan entry.tex and write combined.bib
python -m latex2bundle.combine_bib entry.tex -o combined.bib

# print conflicts and sorted entries by title (use -L DEBUG for more debug output)
python -m latex2bundle.combine_bib entry.tex --print-conflicts --print-sorted=title -L DEBUG
```

Notes:
- The tool follows `\input{}` and `\include{}` recursively to find all bibliography references.
- When duplicate entries (same title) are detected the tool can deduplicate and optionally update TeX files' citation keys to point to the kept key; run with `-L DEBUG` to see detailed debug output before making changes.


# Include extra files with verbose output
latex2bundle path/to/main.tex -c extra.bib myclass.cls -v

# Write bundle to a specific directory
latex2bundle path/to/main.tex -t /tmp/output

# Disable bibliography reduction and figure renaming
latex2bundle path/to/main.tex --no-reduce-bib --no-rename-figures
```
