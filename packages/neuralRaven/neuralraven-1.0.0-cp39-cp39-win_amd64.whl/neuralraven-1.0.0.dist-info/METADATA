# NeuralRaven — Evolutionary Neural Network Library

NeuralRaven is a Python library that implements a fully customizable neural network architecture capable of training itself using an evolutionary algorithm (genetic optimization).  
Unlike traditional machine-learning libraries, neuralRaven **does not use gradient descent, backpropagation, or optimizers**.  
Instead, it evolves network weights over generations.

This makes RAVEN suitable for:
- Environments where gradient-based training performs poorly.
- Reinforcement learning tasks.
- Black-box optimization problems.
- Scenarios with non-differentiable fitness functions.

---

## ✨ Features

- Fully implemented neural network written in Python.
- Genetic/Evolutionary algorithm for self-training.
- Support for mutation, crossover, elitism, and population-based evolution.
- Save/Load functionality for evolved models.
- Small footprint and easy to integrate.
- Cross-platform wheel support (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Compatible with Python 3.8–3.14.

## 📦 Installation

Once the package is published on PyPI:

```bash
pip install neuralRaven
```
If installing from source:

```bash
pip install .
```

## 🚀 Quick Example

```bash
# main.py

import neuralRaven

def main():
    print("=== Executing in neuralRaven.IO.fromFiles() ===")

    # Name files
    config_file = "configurationfile"
    data_file = "datatest"

    try:
        neuralRaven.IO.fromFiles(config_file, data_file)
        print("\n=== Execution complete without errors ===")
    except Exception as e:
        print("\n*** Error in the execution ***")
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 🛠 Building Wheels (for PyPI)

This project uses cibuildwheel to build platform-specific wheels.

GitHub Actions workflows:

.github/workflows/build_wheels.yml — builds wheels for Windows/Linux/macOS.

.github/workflows/publish.yml — publishes wheels to PyPI.
