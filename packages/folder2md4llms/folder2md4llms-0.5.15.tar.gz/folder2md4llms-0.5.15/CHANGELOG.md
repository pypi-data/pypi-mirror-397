## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.15] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed

- **Stale Update Notification Cache**: Updated to `henriqueslab-updater>=1.1.3` to fix stale update notifications
  - Cache now invalidates when current version changes
  - Prevents showing "update available" after already upgrading

## [0.5.14] - 2025-12-14

### Changed
- **Update Checker Modernization**: Migrated to `henriqueslab-updater` package for centralized update checking
  - Removed internal update checker, install detector, and Homebrew checker modules
  - Now uses `henriqueslab-updater>=1.0.0` for all update checking functionality
  - Maintains same user experience with improved code maintainability
  - Reduces code duplication across HenriquesLab packages

### Dependencies

## [0.5.13] - 2025-12-05

### Enhanced
- **Update Checker Improvements**: Significantly enhanced update checking system for better user experience
  - **Async Background Checking**: Update checks now run in background threads without blocking CLI startup (truly non-blocking, no thread.join())
  - **Environment Opt-out**: Added `FOLDER2MD4LLMS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` and standard `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` environment variables for CI/CD and user control
  - **Richer Cache Structure**: Cache now stores `update_available` boolean for immediate notification display without re-checking PyPI
  - **Singleton Pattern**: Global update checker instance prevents redundant checks and improves efficiency
  - **Smart Notifications**: Displays cached update notifications at end of CLI execution without adding latency
  - **Install Detection Integration**: Update checker now uses install detector to provide context-aware upgrade commands

### Changed

### Changed
- **Migrated from Makefile to justfile** for improved developer experience
  - All 12 development commands converted to justfile recipes
  - Python-based implementations for complex logic (check-release, version)
  - Cleaner syntax: `just test -v` vs `make test ARGS="-v"`
  - Better argument passing with variadic parameters
  - Built-in help with `just --list`
  - No .PHONY declarations needed
  - Cross-platform consistency

### Developer Experience
- Contributors should now use `just` instead of `make`
- Installation: `brew install just` (macOS) or `cargo install just`
- Migration is straightforward: `make test` → `just test`, `make setup` → `just setup`
