       This column allows 14 chars, so can store a full GPC with check
       digit.  However as of writing the actual format used here does
       not matter to Sideshow logic; "anything" should work.

       That may change eventually, depending on POS integration
       scenarios that come up.  Maybe a config option to declare
       whether check digit should be included or not, etc.
