# Quick Submit

Quickly commit all changes with a generic "update" message and submit to Graphite.

## Usage

```bash
/quick-submit
```

## Implementation

Run the kit CLI command:

```bash
erk kit exec gt quick-submit
```

## Notes

- This is a shortcut for rapid iteration
- Uses generic "update" commit message
- For proper commit messages, use `/gt:pr-submit` instead
