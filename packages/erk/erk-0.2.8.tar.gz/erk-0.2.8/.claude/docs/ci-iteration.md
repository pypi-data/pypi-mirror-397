# CI Iteration Process

This document describes the standard process for iteratively running CI checks and fixing issues until all checks pass.

## Overview

Run the specified CI target and automatically fix any failures. Keep iterating until all checks pass or you get stuck on an issue that requires human intervention.

**IMPORTANT**: All `make` commands must be run from the repository root directory. The Makefile is located at the root of the repository, not in subdirectories.

## Sub-Agent Policy

🔴 **CRITICAL**: When spawning sub-agents to run `make`, `pytest`, `pyright`, `ruff`, `prettier`, or `gt` commands, you MUST use `devrun`:

```
Task tool with:
- subagent_type: devrun  ← MUST be devrun, NEVER general-purpose
```

**Why**: devrun has hard tool constraints (no Edit/Write) preventing destructive changes. The parent agent (you) processes reports and applies fixes - sub-agents only report.

❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Spawning general-purpose or other sub-agents for make/pytest/pyright/ruff/prettier/gt
❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Giving sub-agents prompts like "fix issues" or "iterate until passing"
✅ **REQUIRED**: Sub-agents run ONE command and report results
✅ **REQUIRED**: Parent agent decides what to fix based on reports

## Iteration Process

### 1. Initial Run

Start by using the devrun agent to run the specified make target from the repository root and see the current state. Use the Task tool to invoke the devrun agent:

```
Task tool with:
- subagent_type: devrun
- description: "Run [make target] from repo root"
- prompt: "Change to repository root and execute: [make target]"
```

The devrun agent will automatically handle running the command from the correct directory.

### 2. Parse Failures

Analyze the output to identify which check(s) failed. Common failure patterns:

- **Ruff lint failures**: Look for "ruff check" errors
- **Format failures**: Look for "ruff format --check" or files that would be reformatted
- **Prettier failures**: Look for markdown files that need formatting
- **MD-check failures**: Look for CLAUDE.md files that don't properly reference AGENTS.md
- **Pyright failures**: Look for type errors with file paths and line numbers
- **Test failures**: Look for pytest failures with test names and assertion errors

### 3. Apply Targeted Fixes

Based on the failure type, apply appropriate fixes:

#### Ruff Lint Failures

Use the devrun agent via the Task tool:

```
Task tool with:
- subagent_type: devrun
- description: "Run make fix from repo root"
- prompt: "Change to repository root and execute: make fix"
```

#### Ruff Format Failures

Use the devrun agent via the Task tool:

```
Task tool with:
- subagent_type: devrun
- description: "Run make format from repo root"
- prompt: "Change to repository root and execute: make format"
```

#### Prettier Failures

Use the devrun agent via the Task tool:

```
Task tool with:
- subagent_type: devrun
- description: "Run make prettier from repo root"
- prompt: "Change to repository root and execute: make prettier"
```

#### Sync-Kit Failures

Run erk sync to update local artifacts:

```bash
erk sync
```

#### MD-Check Failures

AGENTS.md standard violations occur when CLAUDE.md files don't properly reference AGENTS.md:

- Read the error message to identify which CLAUDE.md file has issues
- Ensure the CLAUDE.md file contains only `@AGENTS.md` (nothing else)
- Ensure an AGENTS.md file exists in the same directory as the CLAUDE.md file
- Use Edit tool to fix the CLAUDE.md file or create the missing AGENTS.md file

#### Pyright Type Errors

- Use Read tool to examine the file at the reported line number
- Use Edit tool to fix type annotations, add type hints, or fix type mismatches
- Follow the coding standards in AGENTS.md (use `list[...]` not `List[...]`, etc.)

#### Test Failures

- Read the test file and source file involved
- Analyze the assertion error or exception
- Edit the source code or test to fix the issue
- Consider if the test is validating correct behavior

### 4. Verify Fix

After applying fixes, use the devrun agent to run the make target again to verify:

```
Task tool with:
- subagent_type: devrun
- description: "Run [make target] from repo root"
- prompt: "Change to repository root and execute: [make target]"
```

### 5. Repeat Until Success

Continue the cycle: run → identify failures → fix → verify

## Iteration Control

**Safety Limits:**

- **Maximum iterations**: 10 attempts
- **Stuck detection**: If the same error appears 3 times in a row, stop
- **Progress tracking**: Use TodoWrite to show iteration progress

## Progress Reporting

Use TodoWrite to track your progress:

```
Iteration 1: Fixing lint errors
Iteration 2: Fixing format errors
Iteration 3: Fixing type errors in src/erk/cli/commands/switch.py
Iteration 4: All checks passed
```

Update the status as you work through each iteration.

## When to Stop

**SUCCESS**: Stop when the make target exits with code 0 (all checks passed)

**STUCK**: Stop and report to user if:

1. You've completed 10 iterations without success
2. The same error persists after 3 fix attempts
3. You encounter an error you cannot automatically fix

## Stuck Reporting Format

If you get stuck, report clearly:

```markdown
## Finalization Status: STUCK

I was unable to resolve the following issue after N attempts:

**Check**: [lint/format/prettier/md-check/pyright/test]

**Error**:
[Exact error message]

**File**: [file path if applicable]

**Attempted Fixes**:

1. [What you tried first]
2. [What you tried second]
3. [What you tried third]

**Next Steps**:
[Suggest what needs to be done manually]
```

## Success Reporting Format

When all checks pass, format the output with **blank lines** between each check for proper CLI rendering:

```markdown
## Finalization Status: SUCCESS

All CI checks passed after N iteration(s):

✅ **Lint (ruff check)**: PASSED

✅ **Format (ruff format --check)**: PASSED

✅ **Prettier**: PASSED

✅ **AGENTS.md Standard (md-check)**: PASSED

✅ **Pyright**: PASSED

✅ **Tests**: PASSED

✅ **Sync-Kit (erk check)**: PASSED

The code is ready for commit/PR.

Create insight extraction plan to improve .erk/docs/agent (optional):
/erk:create-extraction-plan
```

**IMPORTANT**: Each check line MUST be separated by a blank line in the markdown output to render properly in the CLI.

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be systematic**: Fix one type of error at a time
2. **Run full CI**: Always run the full make target, not individual checks
3. **Use devrun agent**: Always use the Task tool with devrun agent for ALL make commands
4. **Run from repo root**: Always ensure make commands execute from repository root
5. **Track progress**: Use TodoWrite for every iteration
6. **Don't guess**: Read files before making changes
7. **Follow standards**: Adhere to AGENTS.md coding standards
8. **Fail gracefully**: Report clearly when stuck
9. **Be efficient**: Use targeted fixes (don't reformat everything for one lint error)

## Example Flow

```
Iteration 1:
- Use Task tool with devrun agent to run make target from repo root
- Found: 5 lint errors, 2 files need formatting
- Fix: Use Task tool with devrun agent to run make fix, then make format from repo root
- Result: 3 lint errors remain

Iteration 2:
- Use Task tool with devrun agent to run make target from repo root
- Found: 3 lint errors (imports)
- Fix: Edit files to fix import issues
- Result: All lint/format pass, 2 type errors

Iteration 3:
- Use Task tool with devrun agent to run make target from repo root
- Found: 2 pyright errors in switch.py:45 and switch.py:67
- Fix: Add type annotations
- Result: All checks pass

SUCCESS
```

## Important Reminders

- NEVER run pytest/pyright/ruff/prettier/make/gt directly via Bash
- Always use the Task tool with subagent_type: devrun
- Covered tools: pytest, pyright, ruff, prettier, make, gt
- Always ensure make commands execute from the repository root directory
