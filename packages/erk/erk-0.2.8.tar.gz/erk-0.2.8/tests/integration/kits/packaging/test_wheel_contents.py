"""Integration tests for wheel packaging integrity.

These tests build an actual wheel package using `uv build` and verify that all
required data files are included. The wheel is built once per test session and
shared across all tests via a session-scoped fixture.

This is an integration test (Layer 5) because it:
- Executes real build system (uv build)
- Creates real filesystem artifacts
- Tests the complete packaging pipeline
