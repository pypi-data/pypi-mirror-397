Bermuda 
-----------------------

Bermuda is a Python package for the representation, manipulation,
and exploration of insurance loss triangles, created
by `Korra <https://korra.com>`_.
It offers a user-friendly interface for:

* Loading and saving insurance loss triangles using a number of formats (e.g. JSON, CSV, Pandas :code:`DataFrame` objects, binary files).
* A single :code:`Triangle` class for manipulating triangles of varying complexities (e.g. ragged, multi-program, cumulative or incremental triangles).
* An intuitive :code:`Cell` type that can hold multiple data types and metadata.
* A collection of useful :code:`Cell`- and :code:`Triangle`-level functionality, including summarizing, aggregating, extending, filtering, and bootstrapping insurance loss triangles.
