aiosafeconsumer is a library that provides abstractions and some implementations
to consume data somewhere and process it.

Features:

* Based on AsyncIO
* Type annotated
* Use logging with contextual information

Abstractions:

* `DataSource` - waits for data and returns batch of records using Python generator
* `DataProcessor` - accepts batch of records and precess it
* `DataTransformer` - accepts batch of records and transform it and calls
  another processor to precess it. Extends `DataProcessor`
* `Worker` - abstract worker. Do a long running task
* `ConsumerWorker` - connects `DataSource` and `DataProcessor`. Extends Worker
* `DataWriter` - base abstraction to perform data synchronization. Extends DataProcessor

Current implementations:

* `KafkaSource` - read data from Kafka
* `RedisStreamSource` - read data from Redis Streams
* `RedisWriter` - synchronize data in Redis
* `ElasticsearchWriter` - synchronize data in Elasticsearch
* `MongoDBWriter` - synchronize data in MongoDB
* `PostgresWriter` - synchronize data in PostgreSQL
* `WorkerPool` - controller to setup and run workers in parallel. Can handle worker failures and restarts workers when it fails or exits.
