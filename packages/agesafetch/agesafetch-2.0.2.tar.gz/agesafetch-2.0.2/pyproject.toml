# Metadata for publishing agesafetch as a wheel on PyPI using Maturin.
#
# Maturin does not strictly require a pyproject.toml for building wheels
# (only for sdists), but this file is
#   a) the only way of specifying some PyPI-specific metadata and
#   b) must be present anyway for the project to be installable from Git
#      or a directory (which is also why it cannot just be in `deploy/`).
