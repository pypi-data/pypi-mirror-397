Core Modules: Grids
===================

This gallery highlights examples built around the :mod:`grids` module, which provides the structured backbone
for numerical field representation and finite-difference computation in PyMetric.

The :mod:`grids` module offers a powerful API for constructing regular, scaled, and fully generic
structured grids—each integrated with coordinate system metadata and axis-aware utilities.
These examples demonstrate how to:

- Create uniform and non-uniform spatial grids tied to coordinate systems,
- Extract coordinate arrays,
- Use ghost zones, chunking, and broadcasting,
- Apply field operations like partial derivatives and interpolation.

Whether you're building a finite-difference solver or managing multi-axis tensor data,
these examples provide practical insight into leveraging PyMetric’s spatial grid machinery.
