"""
Field component classes for structured geometric data.

This module defines the :class:`FieldComponent` class, the core data container for single-buffer
components of structured geometric fields in Pisces Geometry. A :class:`FieldComponent` binds together a
numerical buffer (such as a NumPy array, `unyt_array`, or HDF5-backed dataset) with metadata that
describes how it aligns with a structured grid and how it should behave under NumPy-style operations.

Field components are the atomic building blocks of all field objects in the Pisces framework.
They support spatial axis labeling, broadcasting, ufunc overrides, and type coercion,
and are designed to integrate cleanly with NumPy and scientific Python workflows.

    r"""
    A single buffer-aligned component of a geometric field.

    :class:`FieldComponent` represents a dense, spatially resolved data block
    associated with a single component of a geometric field. It couples a numerical buffer
    (e.g., NumPy array, `unyt`, or HDF5 dataset) with metadata about its spatial axes and
    the structured grid on which it resides.

    This class provides the foundational storage and computation interface for fields such as
    :class:`~fields.base.DenseField` and :class:`~fields.tensors.DenseTensorField`. Each
    `FieldComponent` knows which axes it spans, how it aligns with a coordinate grid, and
    can interact seamlessly with NumPy operations through ufunc overrides and broadcasting.

    Key Responsibilities
    --------------------
    - Wrap a structured array-like buffer with grid-aware metadata.
    - Track which grid axes the data aligns with and support broadcasting across compatible fields.
    - Provide NumPy ufunc and array function compatibility.
    - Serve as a backend-neutral data container for differential geometry operations.
    - Support views into the underlying buffer in various formats (e.g., array, `unyt`, raw core).

    Notes
    -----
    Each field in the library is composed of one or more :class:`FieldComponent` instances.
    Most dense fields only contain one, but multi-component or symbolic fields may
    combine many for blockwise decomposition or coordinate basis expansion.

    Unlike higher-level field objects, :class:`FieldComponent` does not track symbolic dependence,
    tensor variance, or units at the field level. It focuses purely on the aligned numerical
    representation of a single data block.
