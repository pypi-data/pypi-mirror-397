"""
Unified buffer system for backend-agnostic field storage in PyMetric.

This module defines the abstract infrastructure for managing numerical data buffers
in PyMetric fields. The buffer system enables :mod:`fields` and its components
to store and manipulate data independently of the underlying storage backend.

Each buffer backend implements a common interface via :py:class:`~fields.buffers.base.BufferBase`, ensuring consistent behavior
for array operations, unit handling, and I/O across field components.

This infrastructure allows developers to build fields and perform computations without
committing to a particular memory or storage strategy, facilitating scalability, portability,
and unit-safe numerical workflows.

For more details on buffers, see :ref:`buffers`.
