Building Fields
==================
This basic tutorial will show how to make fields
of different sorts in pymetric.
"""
# %%
# Fields (e.g. :class:`~fields.base.DenseField` or :class:`~fields.tensors.DenseTensorField`) are the core class of
# pymetric. They are effectively array objects with some knowledge of their underlying geometry and, therefore, are able
# to perform operations like the divergence, curl, or gradient. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basic process
# of creating a field and taking its gradient in a spherical coordinate system.
#
# Step 1: Coordinate Systems
# --------------------------
# The first step in almost all pymetric workflows is to generate a coordinate system for the problem. In this case,
# we'll be using the spherical coordinate system (:class:`~coordinates.coordinate_systems.SphericalCoordinateSystem`).

# Import pymetric and other relevant packages.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

import pymetric as pm

# Create the spherical coordinate system
# object.
coord_sys = pm.SphericalCoordinateSystem()

# %%
# Step 2: Building the Grid
# -------------------------
# Once you've got the coordinate system, the next step is to build a grid. In many cases, the easiest way to
# do so is to use the :class:`~grids.core.GenericGrid`, which requires a coordinate system and a set of
# arrays specifying the coordinates.
#
# In this case, we'll build a **cell-centered** grid in spherical coordinates:

# Build the radial points and
# the angular points.
radii = np.linspace(0.01, 0.99, 100)

# Build the angular points. We'll use 0 -> 2pi and
# 0 -> pi and then take the cell centers from those
theta, phi = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 100), np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
theta = 0.5 * (theta[1:] + theta[:-1])
phi = 0.5 * (phi[1:] + phi[:-1])

# Create a bounding box.
bbox = [[0, 0, 0], [1, np.pi, 2 * np.pi]]

# Create the grid.
grid = pm.GenericGrid(coord_sys, [radii, theta, phi], bbox=bbox, center="cell")

# %%
# Using the grid, we can visualize the rectilinear grid:f
grid.plot_grid_lines(grid_axes=["r", "theta"])
plt.show()

# %%
# Step 3: Building a Field
# ------------------------
# Once the grid has been build, we can construct a field with ease. In this case,
# we'll use one of the many options to make a field: via a function.

# Create the function.
func = lambda r: np.sin(10 * r)

# create the field.
field = pm.DenseTensorField.from_function(func, grid, ["r"])

# %%
# A nice thing to do with the field is to look at its
# projection in the x-z plane. To do this, we'll create
# a grid of points and convert them to spherical coordinates. We can
# then interpolate over the field to build the image.
x, z = np.linspace(-1, 1, 500), np.linspace(-1, 1, 500)
X, Z = np.meshgrid(x, z)

# Convert the coordinates.
R, THETA, _ = coord_sys.from_cartesian(X, 0, Z)

# Create an interpolation of the field.
interp = field.grid.construct_domain_interpolator(
    field[...], ["r"], method="cubic", bounds_error=None
)
IM = interp(R.ravel()).reshape(R.shape)

# sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 2
plt.pcolormesh(X, Z, IM)
plt.gca().set_aspect("equal")
plt.xlabel("X")
plt.ylabel("Z")
plt.show()
