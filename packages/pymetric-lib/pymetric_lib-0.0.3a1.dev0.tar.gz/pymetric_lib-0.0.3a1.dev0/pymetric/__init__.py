"""
Pymetric is a computational geometry library designed to facilitate advanced
geometric and differential operations in a wide range of coordinate systems.
It provides a unified and extensible interface for working with:

- Curvilinear and orthogonal coordinate systems
- Metric tensors and their properties
- Differential operators such as gradient, divergence, and Laplacian
- Tensor transformations and symbolic dependence tracking
- Structured grids for numerical computations
- Buffer abstraction layers for in-memory, unit-aware, and HDF5-backed data

Pymetric is built to serve scientific computing applications involving
non-Cartesian geometries, such as plasma physics, astrophysics, general relativity,
and other fields requiring curvilinear analysis.

This package is part of the Pisces ecosystem and is designed to integrate
cleanly with other Pisces geometry and simulation tools.
