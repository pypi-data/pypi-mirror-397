title: "gnomAD v4.1 GRCh37 VEP Cache (AF ≥ 0.05, basic annotations)"

description: |
  VCFcache annotated cache for gnomAD v4.1 GRCh37 variants (AF ≥ 0.05),
  annotated with Ensembl VEP 115.2.

  This cache contains 10.4M pre-annotated common variants (≥5% allele frequency)
  from gnomAD v4.1, lifted over from GRCh38 to GRCh37 coordinates. Each variant
  has been annotated with VEP 115.2 using the basic annotation preset.

  VEP Annotations Included (CSQ INFO field):
  - Gene symbol (--symbol)
  - HGVS nomenclature (--hgvs)
  - Variant classification (--variant_class)

  This cache enables rapid annotation of sample VCFs by:
  1. Instantly applying pre-computed annotations for common variants (cache hits)
  2. Only running VEP on novel variants not in the cache (cache misses)

  Typical speedup: 10-100x faster than annotating all variants from scratch.

  Coverage: chr1-22, chrX, chrY (GRCh37/hg19 coordinates)
  Blueprint source: gnomAD v4.1 GRCh37 liftover (AF ≥ 0.05)
  Annotation tool: Ensembl VEP 115.2 (via Apptainer)
  VEP cache: Ensembl 115, GRCh37

  Usage:
    vcfcache annotate -a <cache_dir> -i sample.vcf.gz -o output/

notes: |
  Built from gnomAD v4.1 GRCh37 liftover blueprint (AF ≥ 0.05).
  Annotated using VEP 115.2 with Ensembl cache version 115.

  VEP configuration:
  - Assembly: GRCh37
  - Buffer size: 500,000 variants
  - Parallel forks: 8
  - Mode: offline (no database queries)
  - Output format: VCF with CSQ INFO field

  Cache structure:
  - Blueprint: 10.4M variants (positions only, no genotypes)
  - Annotated cache: 10.4M pre-annotated variants with VEP CSQ field
  - Size: ~56 MB compressed

  When using this cache to annotate samples, only variants NOT found in the
  cache will be annotated with VEP, dramatically reducing annotation time.

  Compatible with vcfcache >= 0.3.0
