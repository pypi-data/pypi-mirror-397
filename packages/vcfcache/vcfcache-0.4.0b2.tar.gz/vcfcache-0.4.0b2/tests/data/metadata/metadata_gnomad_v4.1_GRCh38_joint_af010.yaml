title: "gnomAD v4.1 GRCh38 Blueprint (AF ≥ 0.10)"

description: |
  VCFcache blueprint derived from gnomAD v4.1 joint frequency data (GRCh38).

  This blueprint contains 8.1M high-quality variant sites filtered to
  allele frequency (AF) ≥ 0.10 (10% or 1 in 10 individuals). All genotype
  and INFO fields have been removed, retaining only genomic positions
  (CHROM, POS, REF, ALT). Multiallelic sites have been split into separate records.

  Coverage: chr1-22, chrX, chrY
  Source: gnomAD v4.1.0 joint frequency (807,162 samples)
  Processing: AF-filtered (≥10%), normalized, GT/INFO removed, multiallelics split

  This blueprint serves as a foundation for building annotation caches with
  tools like VEP, SnpEff, or bcftools +split-vep, enabling rapid annotation
  of sample VCFs by pre-annotating very common variants (≥10% population frequency).
