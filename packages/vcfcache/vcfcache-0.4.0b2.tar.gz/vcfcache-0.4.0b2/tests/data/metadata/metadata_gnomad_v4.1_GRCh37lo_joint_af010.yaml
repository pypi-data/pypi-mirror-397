title: "gnomAD v4.1 GRCh37 Blueprint (AF ≥ 0.10, lifted from GRCh38)"

description: |
  VCFcache blueprint derived from gnomAD v4.1 joint frequency data,
  lifted over from GRCh38 to GRCh37 (hg19).

  This blueprint contains 8.0M high-quality variant sites filtered to
  allele frequency (AF) ≥ 0.10 (10% or 1 in 10 individuals), then lifted
  over from GRCh38 to GRCh37 using CrossMap. All genotype and INFO fields
  have been removed, retaining only genomic positions (CHROM, POS, REF, ALT).
  Multiallelic sites have been split into separate records.

  Coverage: chr1-22, chrX, chrY (GRCh37 coordinates)
  Source: gnomAD v4.1.0 joint frequency (807,162 samples)
  Processing: AF-filtered (≥10%), GRCh38→GRCh37 liftover, normalized,
              GT/INFO removed, multiallelics split

  NOTE: This is a liftover from GRCh38. For native GRCh38 analysis, use the
  GRCh38 blueprint instead.

  This blueprint serves as a foundation for building annotation caches with
  tools like VEP, SnpEff, or bcftools +split-vep, enabling rapid annotation
  of sample VCFs using GRCh37/hg19 coordinates with very common variants
  (≥10% population frequency).
