I wanted to follow up on the demo we did last week.\n\nJohn: Yes, the team was impressed with the automation features. We're evaluating a few options.\n\nSales Rep: What specific challenges are you trying to solve?\n\nJohn: Mainly workflow automation and reducing manual data entry. We spend about 20 hours a week on repetitive tasks.\n\nSales Rep: Our solution typically reduces that by 80%. The ROI is usually seen within 3 months.\n\nJohn: That sounds promising. What's the implementation timeline?\n\nSales Rep: Usually 4-6 weeks including training.\n\nJohn: I'll need to discuss with our CFO. Can you send over a formal proposal?",
