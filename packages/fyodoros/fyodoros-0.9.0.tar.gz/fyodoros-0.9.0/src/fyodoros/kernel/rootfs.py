    Resolves a virtual path to a safe absolute path within FYODOR_ROOT.

    PERFORMANCE: This function is cached to avoid repeated disk hits (stat/readlink)
    for path resolution.

    SECURITY NOTE:
    Caching 'resolve' implies we assume the symlink topology of the resolved path
    does not change frequently. In a single-agent environment where the agent
    cannot create symlinks (no sys_symlink), this is generally safe.
    However, if an external process modifies symlinks inside ~/.fyodor while
    the agent is running, this cache might return a path that was safe
    but is now unsafe (TOCTOU). Given the threat model (Agent inside sandbox),
    this optimization is acceptable.

    Args:
        virtual_path (str): The virtual path (e.g., "/home/notes.txt").

    Returns:
        Path: The absolute path on the host system.

    Raises:
        SecurityError: If the resolved path is outside FYODOR_ROOT.
