Flexible, extensible, hardware-agnostic gravitational-wave population inference.

- [Issues](https://github.com/ColmTalbot/GWPopulation/issues)
- [Contributing](https://colmtalbot.github.io/gwpopulation/contributing/index.html)

It provides:

- Simple use of GPU-acceleration via [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [cupy](https://cupy.dev/).
- Implementations of widely used likelihood compatible with [Bilby](https://docs.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby).
- A standard format for defining new population models.
- A collection of standard population models.

If you're using this on high-performance computing clusters, you may be interested in the associated pipeline code [gwpopulation_pipe](https://docs.ligo.org/RatesAndPopulations/gwpopulation_pipe/).

Additionally, please consider citing the original references for the implemented models which should be include in docstrings.
