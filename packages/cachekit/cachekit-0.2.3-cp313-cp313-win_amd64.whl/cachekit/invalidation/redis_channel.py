"""Redis Pub/Sub implementation of InvalidationChannel protocol.

This module provides production-ready cross-pod L1 cache invalidation using
Redis Pub/Sub messaging. Supports multiple subscribers with automatic
reconnection and exponential backoff.

IMPORTANT: Redis Pub/Sub is at-most-once delivery (fire-and-forget). Messages
published while a subscriber is disconnected are lost. This is acceptable for
cache invalidation because L1 entries eventually expire via TTL. Cross-pod
invalidation is a best-effort optimization for reducing stale cache window.

Architecture:
- Dedicated PubSub connection (separate from main Redis client)
- Daemon listener thread (name="cachekit-invalidation-listener")
- threading.RLock for state protection
- Exponential backoff reconnection (1.0s -> 2.0s -> 4.0s -> ... -> 30.0s max)
- Optional metrics hooks via self._metrics attribute
