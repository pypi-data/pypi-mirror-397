"""InvalidationChannel protocol for cross-pod cache invalidation.

This module defines the protocol for broadcasting invalidation events across
multiple L1 cache instances. Implementations may use Redis Pub/Sub, HTTP SSE,
WebSockets, or other messaging systems.

Protocol uses structural subtyping (PEP 544) - any class implementing these
methods is considered a valid InvalidationChannel.

Note:
    Callback must not raise exceptions. Exceptions are logged and suppressed

class InvalidationChannel(Protocol):
    """Protocol for broadcasting cache invalidation events.

    This protocol defines the contract for invalidation channels that enable
    cross-pod L1 cache invalidation. All methods must be thread-safe.

    Design principles:
    - Fire-and-forget publishing (never raises, never blocks)
    - Multiple subscribers supported (fan-out)
    - Graceful degradation (cache works even if channel unavailable)
    - Idempotent lifecycle (start/stop can be called multiple times)

    Example:
        >>> from cachekit.invalidation import RedisInvalidationChannel
        >>> channel = RedisInvalidationChannel(redis_client)  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> channel.subscribe(lambda event: cache.handle_invalidation(event))  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> channel.start()  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> channel.stop()  # doctest: +SKIP

            event: The InvalidationEvent to broadcast

        Note:
            If channel is unavailable, event is dropped and logged. This is
            acceptable because L1 cache entries eventually expire via TTL.
            Cross-pod invalidation is a best-effort optimization.
