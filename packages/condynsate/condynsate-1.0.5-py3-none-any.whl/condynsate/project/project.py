class Project:
    """
    The Project class ties together a Simulator, Visualizer, Animator, and
    Keyboard into class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    **kwargs

    Keyword Args
    ------------
    simulator_gravity : 3 tuple of floats, optional
        The gravity vector used in the simulation. The default value is
        (0.0, 0.0, -9.81).
    simulator_dt : float, optional
        The finite time step size used by the simulator. If set too
        small, can result in visualizer, simulator desynch. Too small
        is determined by the number of total links in the simulation.
        The default value is 0.01.
    visualizer : bool, optional
        A boolean flag that indicates if the project should include a
        visualizer. This visualizer provides a 3D rendering of the
        simulation state. The default is True.
    visualizer_frame_rate : bool, optional
        The frame rate of the visualizer. When None, attempts to run at
        unlimited. This is not reccomended because it can cause
        communication bottlenecks that cause slow downs. The default
        value is 45.
    visualizer_record : bool, optional
        A boolean flag that indicates if the visualizer will record.
        True, all frames from the start function call to the terminate
        function call are recorded. After the terminate function call,
        these frames are saved with h.264 and outputs in an MP4
        container. The saved file name has the form visualizer.mp4.
        The default is False.
    animator : bool, optional
        A boolean flag that indicates if the project should include an
        animator. This animator provides real-time 2D plotting.
        The default is False.
    animator_frame_rate : float, optional
        The upper limit of the allowed frame rate in frames per second.
        When set, the animator will not update faster than this speed.
        The default is 15.0
    animator_record : bool, optional
        A boolean flag that indicates if the animator should be
        recorded. If True, all frames from the start function call to
        the terminate function call are recorded. After the terminate
        function call, these frames are saved with h.264 and outputs in
        an MP4 container. The saved file name has the form
        animator.mp4. The default is False.

        Parameters
        ----------
        real_time : bool, optional
            A boolean flag that indicates whether the step is to be taken in
            real time (True) or as fast as possible (False).

            When real_time is True and stable_step is False, the time of the

            every subsequent step() call, the function will sleep until it has
            been exactly dt*(n-1) seconds since the noted epoch. dt is the
            simulator time step and n is the number of times step() has been
            called since instantiation or reset. This guarantees a more
            accurate total run time, but less stable frame rates, especially
            if, at any point while running a simulation, there is a long pause
            between step() calls.

            When real_time and stable_step are True, the function will sleep
            until the duration since the last time step() was called is equal
            to the time step of the simulation. This guarantees a more stable
            frame rate, but less accurate total run time.
