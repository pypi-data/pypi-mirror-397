# Ape Design Philosophy

## Core Identity

Ape is designed to serve two complementary roles:

### 1. A Bridge Language (Translator)
Ape acts as a **deterministic translator** between human/AI intent and target languages like Python, TypeScript, or Rust. When you write Ape:
- Humans express their intent in clear, structured language
- AI models can generate correct Ape code with minimal instructions
- The compiler translates this unambiguously to production-ready code in the target language
- **No guessing, no ambiguity, no surprises**

### 2. A Destination Language (Standalone)
Ape is also a **complete programming language** with its own:
- Module system with deterministic resolution
- Standard library (sys, io, math)
- Type system and semantic rules
- Compilation and execution model

This dual nature makes Ape ideal for AI-assisted development while maintaining the rigor of traditional programming languages.

## Design Principles

### 1. Deterministic by Default

**Every aspect of Ape is deterministic and predictable.**

- Same input → same output, always
- No hidden state, no implicit behavior
- Module resolution follows a fixed, stable search order
- Name mangling uses a consistent, documented scheme

**Why this matters:**
- AI models can reliably generate correct code
- Humans can reason about programs without surprises
- Code reviews are straightforward
- Refactoring is safe

### 2. No Guessing: Fail Loud, Fail Fast

**If something is unclear or ambiguous, the compiler stops with a clear error.**

```
✗ Module 'math' not found
  Searched: ./lib/math.ape, ./math.ape, <APE_INSTALL>/ape_std/math.ape
  
✗ Symbol 'add' is ambiguous
  Imported from: 'math', 'bigint'
  Use qualified names: math.add, bigint.add
```

**No fallbacks, no warnings-that-should-be-errors, no "best effort" resolution.**

This philosophy extends to:
- Missing modules → hard error
- Circular dependencies → detected and reported
- Type mismatches → compilation fails
- Ambiguous imports → must be clarified

**Why this matters:**
- Errors are caught at compile time, not runtime
- Error messages guide the user to the fix
- AI models receive clear feedback to correct their output
- Production code is more reliable

### 3. Explicit Over Implicit

**"What is not declared does not exist."**

This core principle means:
- All modules must declare their name: `module math`
- All imports must be stated: `import sys`
- All types must be specified: `x: Integer`
- All constraints must be listed: `- deterministic`

**No implicit imports, no automatic conversions, no "magic" behavior.**

**Why this matters:**
- Code is self-documenting
- Dependencies are visible at a glance
- AI models have a clear template to follow
- Maintenance is easier

### 4. Optimized for AI Collaboration

**Ape's syntax and semantics are designed to be AI-friendly.**

Features that help AI:
- **Consistent structure**: Tasks always have inputs, outputs, constraints, steps
- **Clear keywords**: `module`, `import`, `task`, `entity`, `constraints`
- **Predictable resolution**: Module search follows documented order
- **Stable semantics**: Language rules don't change based on context
- **Explicit contracts**: Types, constraints, and deviations are declared

**Why this matters:**
- AI can generate syntactically and semantically correct Ape code
- Fewer iterations needed between AI and human
- Clear errors help AI self-correct
- Knowledge transfer from one AI model to another is reliable

### 5. Controlled Deviation System (CDS)

**Flexibility where needed, strictness everywhere else.**

Ape recognizes that some problems require creative solutions:

```ape
task calculate_smart:
    inputs:
        request: CalculationRequest
    outputs:
        result: CalculationResult
        summary: String
    
    constraints:
        - result is deterministic
    
    controlled_deviation:
        scope: steps
        bounds:
            - summary can vary in natural language phrasing
            - summary must include the numeric result
        rationale: "Human-readable summary requires natural variation"
    
    steps:
        - calculate result deterministically
        - generate summary with flexibility
        - return result and summary
```

**The key**: Deviations are **explicit, bounded, and justified**.

**Why this matters:**
- Determinism where it counts (calculations, logic)
- Creativity where appropriate (summaries, formatting)
- Clear boundaries prevent deviation creep
- AI understands when to be precise vs. creative

## Ape as a Bridge Language

### The Translation Model

```
Human Intent
    ↓
  Ape Code (structured, deterministic)
    ↓
  Compiler (no ambiguity, clear errors)
    ↓
Target Language (Python, TypeScript, etc.)
    ↓
  Execution
```

### Why Use Ape as a Translator?

1. **AI-Optimized Syntax**: Easier for AI to generate than Python directly
2. **Deterministic Mapping**: One Ape construct → one target construct
3. **Validation at Every Step**: Catch errors before they reach target language
4. **Multi-Target Support**: Write once in Ape, compile to many languages
5. **Documentation Built-In**: Ape's structure forces clear specification

### Example: Ape → Python

**Ape Source:**
```ape
module calculator

import math

task add_numbers:
    inputs:
        a: Integer
        b: Integer
    outputs:
        result: Integer
    
    constraints:
        - deterministic
    
    steps:
        - call math.add with a and b to get result
        - return result
```

**Generated Python:**
```python
# Generated from calculator.ape

def calculator__add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Task: add_numbers
    Constraints: deterministic
    """
    result = math__add(a, b)
    return result
```

**Key Points:**
- Module name `calculator` → function prefix `calculator__`
- Import `math` → dependency on `math__add`
- Deterministic mapping: no interpretation needed
- Type annotations preserved
- Documentation generated automatically

## Ape as a Destination Language

### A Complete Language

Ape is not just a translator - it's a full programming language with:

**Module System:**
- Module declarations: `module name`
- Import statements: `import module`
- Deterministic resolution: lib/ → . → ape_std/
- Circular dependency detection

**Standard Library:**
- `sys`: System operations (print, exit)
- `io`: Input/output (read_file, write_file)
- `math`: Mathematics (add, multiply, power)
- More modules in future versions

**Type System:**
- Primitive types: Integer, String, Boolean, Float
- User-defined: entity, enum
- Type checking at compile time

**Semantic Rules:**
- Tasks must have inputs, outputs, steps
- Entities must declare fields
- Constraints must be satisfied
- Policies must be enforced

**Why Use Ape Standalone?**

1. **Clarity**: Ape code is more explicit than most languages
2. **Safety**: Determinism and type checking catch bugs early
3. **AI-Friendly**: Easier to work with AI on Ape than other languages
4. **Documentation**: Structure forces good documentation
5. **Multi-Target**: Write once, compile to many languages

---

## Summary

**Ape is deterministic, explicit, and AI-optimized.**

It serves as:
- A **bridge** between human intent and machine code
- A **destination** for standalone programs
- A **contract** that AI and humans both understand

**Core Philosophy:**
> "What is allowed, is fully allowed.  
> What is forbidden, is strictly forbidden.  
> What is not declared, does not exist."

This makes Ape ideal for the age of AI-assisted software development.
