# APE Release Governance & SemVer Policy

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Active  
**Scope:** Defines release process and semantic versioning for APE v1.0+

This document establishes the governance process for APE releases, semantic versioning interpretation, and compatibility guarantees.

---

## 1. Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

APE follows **Semantic Versioning 2.0.0** (semver.org) with APE-specific interpretations.

### 1.1 Version Format

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]
```

**Examples:**
- `1.0.0` - Initial stable release
- `1.1.0` - New features, backward compatible
- `1.0.1` - Bug fix, backward compatible
- `2.0.0-alpha.1` - Pre-release for major version
- `1.5.3+20250106` - Build metadata

### 1.2 Version Increment Rules

**MAJOR (X.0.0)** - Incompatible API changes
- Breaking syntax changes
- Breaking semantic changes
- Public API removals or signature changes
- Type system overhaul

**MINOR (1.X.0)** - New features, backward compatible
- New syntax (with new keywords)
- New stdlib modules
- New capabilities
- New APIs (additive only)
- Performance improvements

**PATCH (1.0.X)** - Bug fixes, backward compatible
- Bug fixes in runtime
- Documentation corrections
- Error message improvements
- Security patches (non-breaking)

---

## 2. What Constitutes a Breaking Change

### 2.1 BREAKING (Requires Major Version)

**❌ Syntax Changes**
```ape
# Removing or changing keywords
# v1.x: task → v2.x: function  (BREAKING)
```

**❌ Semantic Changes**
```ape
# Changing execution behavior
# v1.x: while evaluates condition before loop
# v2.x: while evaluates condition after loop  (BREAKING)
```

**❌ Public API Changes**
```python
# Removing or changing public API
# v1.x: executor.execute(ast, context)
# v2.x: executor.run(ast)  (BREAKING)
```

**❌ Type System Changes**
```ape
# Changing type inference or validation
# v1.x: Integer accepted
# v2.x: Integer rejected  (BREAKING)
```

**❌ Error Behavior Changes**
```python
# Changing when errors are raised
# v1.x: Missing capability → CapabilityError
# v2.x: Missing capability → silent ignore  (BREAKING)
```

### 2.2 NON-BREAKING (Minor/Patch OK)

**✅ Adding New Syntax (with new keywords)**
```ape
# v1.0: No match statement
# v1.5: match statement added (with new "match" keyword)
# Non-breaking: old code still works
```

**✅ Adding New APIs**
```python
# v1.0: No explanation API
# v1.2: ExplanationEngine added
# Non-breaking: additive only
```

**✅ Performance Improvements**
```python
# v1.0: Slow executor
# v1.1: 10x faster executor
# Non-breaking: same output, faster
```

**✅ Bug Fixes**
```python
# v1.0: loop variable leaks into parent scope (bug)
# v1.0.1: loop variable scoped correctly (fix)
# Non-breaking: bug fixes don't count as breaking
```

**✅ Documentation**
```markdown
# Clarifications, examples, typo fixes
# Always non-breaking
```

### 2.3 Edge Cases

**Security Fixes**
- If fix changes behavior: Patch version + migration guide
- If fix requires breaking change: Fast-tracked major version

**Accidental Breaking Changes**
- Revert in patch release
- Document in CHANGELOG as regression
- Add test to prevent recurrence

---

## 3. Deprecation Process

### 3.1 Deprecation Timeline

**Minor Version N: Deprecate**
- Mark feature as deprecated
- Add runtime warning (optional)
- Document alternative in CHANGELOG

**Minor Version N+1: Still Works**
- Feature still functional
- Warning remains
- Migration guide updated

**Major Version N+1: Remove**
- Feature removed
- Breaking change documented
- Migration guide final

**Example:**
```
v1.5.0 - Deprecate old_api()
v1.6.0 - old_api() still works with warning
v1.7.0 - old_api() still works with warning
v2.0.0 - old_api() removed
```

### 3.2 Deprecation Notice Format

**In Code:**
```python
@deprecated(since="1.5.0", remove_in="2.0.0", alternative="new_api")
def old_api():
    warnings.warn(
        "old_api() is deprecated since 1.5.0 and will be removed in 2.0.0. "
        "Use new_api() instead.",
        DeprecationWarning
    )
```

**In Docs:**
```markdown
## old_api()

⚠️ **DEPRECATED** - Since v1.5.0, removed in v2.0.0  
Use `new_api()` instead.
```

**In CHANGELOG:**
```markdown
## [1.5.0] - 2025-03-15

### Deprecated
- `old_api()` - Use `new_api()` instead. Removal planned for 2.0.0.
```

### 3.3 What Can Be Deprecated

**✅ Allowed:**
- Semi-internal APIs (with notice)
- Experimental features
- Suboptimal APIs with better alternatives

**❌ Not Allowed (1.x):**
- Core syntax
- Public API (compile, validate, run)
- Built-in capabilities
- Error types

---

## 4. Experimental Features

### 4.1 Marking Experimental

Features may be marked experimental:

**In Code:**
```python
@experimental(since="1.3.0", stable_in="1.5.0 or 2.0.0")
class NewFeature:
    pass
```

**In Docs:**
```markdown
## NewFeature

🧪 **EXPERIMENTAL** - Since v1.3.0  
API may change in minor releases. Stabilizes in 1.5.0 or 2.0.0.
```

**In CHANGELOG:**
```markdown
## [1.3.0] - 2025-06-01

### Experimental
- NewFeature API - Subject to change in minor releases
```

### 4.2 Experimental Stability

**Experimental features:**
- ✅ Can change in minor versions (within reason)
- ✅ Can be removed in major versions
- ❌ Cannot break stable features
- ❌ Cannot be used in critical path

**Stability Timeline:**
```
v1.3.0 - Experimental feature added
v1.4.0 - Experimental (may change)
v1.5.0 - Stable (no changes without deprecation)
```

### 4.3 Graduation to Stable

**Requirements:**
- At least 1 minor version cycle as experimental
- Positive community feedback
- No outstanding design issues
- Test coverage >90%

- Breaking changes (even if justified)

### 14.2 Migration Guide Template

```markdown
# Migration Guide: v1.x to v2.0

## Breaking Changes

### 1. old_api() Removed
**What Changed:** old_api() no longer exists  
**Why:** Replaced by new_api() with better semantics  
**Migration:**
```python
# v1.x
result = old_api(x, y)

# v2.0
result = new_api(x, y)
```

### 2. Syntax Change: task → function
**What Changed:** keyword changed  
**Why:** Better aligns with other languages  
**Migration:** Use find-replace to update `.ape` files
```
