/**
 * @brief Akida engine unit test based on TESTNAME configuration
 *
 * This method takes a pointer to a target-specifc HardwareDriver
 * implementation.
 *
 * The driver would typically be instantiated by a target-specific main
 * application calling the method.
 *
 * The implementation of the method relies on three serialized arrays:
 * - the program,
 * - the predefined test inputs,
 * - the expected test outputs.
 *
 * The method first instantiates a device corresponding to the specified driver,
 * then loads the serialized program from the test configuration.
 *
 * It then performs an inference on the predefined inputs and compares the
 * result with the expected outputs.
 *
 * @param driver : an implementation of an akida::HardwareDriver
 * @param on_engine_event : a callback that will be called on several Engine
 * events
 * @return true if the hardware outputs match the expected outputs.
