    Computes the SHA512 crypt value for the password given the salt.

    The number of rounds is hardcoded to 5000 as expected by EOS.

    Args:
      password: The password.
      salt: The salt to use (truncated to 16 characters). Allowed characters are [a-zA-Z0-9/.].

    Returns:
      The sha512 crypt value.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If the salt is empty or contain invalid characters.

    Encrypt the data string using CBC TripleDES.

    Args:
        key: The encryption key.
        data: The data to be encrypted.

    Returns:
        str: The encrypted data, encoded in base64.

    Verify if an encrypted password is decryptable with the given key.

    It does not return the password but only raises an error if the password cannot be decrypted.
