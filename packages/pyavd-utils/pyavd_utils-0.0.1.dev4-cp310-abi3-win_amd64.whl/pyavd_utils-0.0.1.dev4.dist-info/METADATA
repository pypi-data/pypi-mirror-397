## ⚠️ Danger

This package is an **internal dependency** designed solely for the use of the `pyavd` Python library. It exposes low-level functionality and is not intended for direct use by end-users.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Should not be used directly** and **may not follow semantic versioning**.
>
> Changes in minor and patch versions may include breaking API changes without prior notice.

## Purpose

`pyavd-utils` provides functionalities in **Rust** for the Python package, **PyAVD**.

**PyAVD** is designed to expose the core logic of the **AVD** Ansible collection (`arista.avd`) as a standalone, dependency-lite Python library. This allows developers to utilize AVD's complex data processing capabilities—like **input validation**, **AVD facts generation**, and **structured configuration generation**—within custom Python applications without requiring a full Ansible installation or runtime.

This repository, `pyavd-utils`, provides functionalities to PyAVD, specifically handling the heavy lifting of data structure validation and manipulation with the speed and safety guarantees of **Rust**.
