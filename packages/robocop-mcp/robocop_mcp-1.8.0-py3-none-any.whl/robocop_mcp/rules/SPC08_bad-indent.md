Fix line indentation issues. Lines should be properly indented according to their
context (inside keywords, test cases, control structures, etc.).

Common issue: Lines that are under-indented or over-indented relative to their
containing block.

Fix automatically by adjusting indentation to match the expected level. Continue
without asking.
