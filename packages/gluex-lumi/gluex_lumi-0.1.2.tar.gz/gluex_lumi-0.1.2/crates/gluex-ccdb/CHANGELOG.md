### Added

- release-ready I hope

- *(rcdb)* first draft of RCDB python interface
- first draft of RCDB function, move some constants into gluex-core
- restructure crates a bit and add RCDB skeleton crate
- add python interface, rename Database to CCDB, and add a lot of helpers/alternate methods. rename subdir(s) to dir(s)
- add prelude, use CCDBResult alias, and add column_types to RowView and column iterators

### Fixed

- add tests and found flipped column/row arguments in python API
- change timestamp getter names and add comments/descriptions to python
- clear ty check
- add some helper methods to Data/RowView and change accessor function names

### Other
