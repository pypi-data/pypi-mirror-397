# Beancount Fava MCP Server

An MCP server to interface with Beancount Fava.

## Installation

```bash
uvx beancount-fava-mcp@0.0.1 --fava-url=https://your-fava-instance/ledger-name
```

Sorry first release help line wasn't correct
1. it doesn't need owner like npx does
2. it didn't have /ledger-name at the end of the URL. You will need it otherwise there is no /api endpoint.

## Usage

Can be used with Claude Desktop or other MCP clients.
