    Newton's method for solving non-linear problems of the form A(u)=0.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BilinearForm
      The BilinearForm of the non-linear variational problem. It does not have to be assembled.
    
    u : GridFunction
      The GridFunction where the solution is saved. The values are used as initial guess for Newton's method.
    
    freedofs : BitArray
      The FreeDofs on which the assembled matrix is inverted. If argument is 'None' then the FreeDofs of the underlying FESpace is used.
    
    maxit : int
      Number of maximal iteration for Newton. If the maximal number is reached before the maximal error Newton might no converge and a warning is displayed.
    
    maxerr : float
      The maximal error which Newton should reach before it stops. The error is computed by the square root of the inner product of the residuum and the correction.
    
    inverse : string
      A string of the sparse direct solver which should be solved for inverting the assembled Newton matrix.
    
    dampfactor : float
      Set the damping factor for Newton's method. If dampfactor is 1 then no damping is done. If value is < 1 then the damping is done by the formula 'min(1,dampfactor*numit)' for the correction, where 'numit' denotes the Newton iteration.
    
    printing : bool
      Set if Newton's method should print informations about the actual iteration like the error. 
    
    Returns
    -------
    (int, int)
      List of two integers. The first one is 0 if Newton's method did converge, -1 otherwise. The second one gives the number of Newton iterations needed.

    linesearch : bool
      If True then linesearch is used to guarantee that the energy decreases in every Newton iteration.
    
    printing : bool
      Set if Newton's method should print informations about the actual iteration like the error. 
    
    Returns
