<h3 align="center">A toolbox to make working with QML models easier.</h3>
<br/>

This repo contains some of the commonly used Ansaetze and coding stuff required for working with QML and Data-Reuploading models.
There are also dedicated classes to calculate entanglement and expressiblity of a provided model as well as its Fourier coefficients.
Checkout our [Arxiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06695) to learn more.
