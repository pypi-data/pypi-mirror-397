# slowql/src/slowql/rules/__init__.py
"""
Rules module for SlowQL.

This module provides:
- Base rule class for defining detection rules
- Rule registry for managing rules
- Rule catalog with all built-in rules

Rules are the atomic units of detection in SlowQL. Each rule
checks for a specific issue pattern and produces Issue objects
when the pattern is detected.

Example:
    >>> from slowql.rules import Rule, RuleRegistry
    >>>
    >>> class SelectStarRule(Rule):
    ...     id = "PERF-SCAN-001"
    ...     name = "SELECT * Usage"
    ...     dimension = Dimension.PERFORMANCE
    ...     severity = Severity.MEDIUM
    ...
    ...     def check(self, query):
    ...         # Detection logic...
    ...         pass
