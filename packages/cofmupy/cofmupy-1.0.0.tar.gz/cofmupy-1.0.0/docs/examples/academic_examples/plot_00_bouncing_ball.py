"""
The "Bouncing Ball"
===================

This example demonstrates how to use CoFmuPy to run the famous **Bouncing Ball** example.
The FMU simulates a ball bouncing on the ground.

"""

# %%
# # The original bouncing ball example
#
# We will load and run the simulation of the Bouncing Ball FMU.
#
# First, let's define the configuration for the Bouncing Ball system. Instead of using a
# JSON file, we will directly create the configuration in a Python dictionary.

from cofmupy import Coordinator

# We define a simple CoFmuPy config dictionary with a single FMU and no connection
config = {
    "fmus": [
        {"id": "bouncing_ball", "path": "../../../resources/fmus/BouncingBall.fmu"}
    ],
    "connections": []
}

# We create a Coordinator object and start it with the config dictionary
coordinator = Coordinator()
coordinator.start(config)

# Let's check the default value of the coefficient of restitution `e` in the FMU.
# A variable in CoFmuPy is identified by a tuple (fmu_id, variable_name).
e = coordinator.get_variable(("bouncing_ball", "e"))
print("Default value of coefficient of restitution 'e' (from the FMU):", e)

# %%
# We now run the simulation for 2.8 seconds with a 10 ms time step. We retrieve the
# results and plot the height of the ball over time.

step_size = 0.01  # 10 ms time step
end_time = 2.8  # Simulation time in seconds

coordinator.run_simulation(step_size, end_time)
results = coordinator.get_results()

# The results is a dictionary with the time and the values of the variables.
print("Results keys:", results.keys())

    plt.plot(results["time"], results[("bouncing_ball", "h")])
    plt.grid()
    plt.title("Bouncing Ball Height over time")
    plt.xlabel("Time [s]")
    plt.ylabel("Height [m]")


plot_height(results)


# %%
# # Variable initialization
#
# We will now see how to set the initial values of the FMU variables. First, let's
# look at the variables in the Bouncing Ball FMU and their causality.

variables = coordinator.get_variable_names()
print("Variables in the Bouncing Ball FMU (and their causality):")
for var in variables:
    print(f"- '{var[1]}': {coordinator.get_causality(var)}")


# %%
# In the following, we will set the coefficient of restitution `e` to 0.5, meaning that
# the ball will bounce less high than in the reference simulation.
#
# The initialization of the FMU variables is done in the configuration file (or in the
# dictionary here). The `initialization` key is used to set the initial values of the
# FMU variables. The values are set before the simulation starts.

    ]
}

coordinator.start(config)

coordinator.run_simulation(step_size, end_time)

results = coordinator.get_results()

# %%
# We can also set the initial height `h` of the ball to 5 meters. `h` is an output
# variable but its start value can be set at initialization of the FMU.

# # Comparison with the analytical solution
#
# To validate the simulation with CoFmuPy, we compare the results with the analytical
# solution of the bouncing ball model as defined in the
# [reference FMU](https://github.com/modelica/Reference-FMUs/blob/v0.0.39/BouncingBall/readme.md).

# # Conclusion
#
# In this example, we have seen how to use CoFmuPy to run the Bouncing Ball FMU. We
# have learnt how to:
#
# - Load the FMU and run a simulation
# - Retrieve and plot the results
# - Modify the initial values of the FMU variables
