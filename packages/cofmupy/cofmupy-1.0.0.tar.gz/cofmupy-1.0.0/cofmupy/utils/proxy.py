    FmuProxy is a Python class that mimics the API of an FMU.
    It provides a framework for registering and managing variables, as well as
    implementing a simulation step mechanism. This class is intended to be
    subclassed, with the `do_step` method implemented by concrete proxies.
    Attributes:
        author (str): The author of the proxy. Defaults to an empty string.
        description (str): A description of the proxy. Defaults to an empty string.
        model_identifier (str): The identifier for the model. Defaults to "FmuProxy".
        default_step_size (Optional[float]): The default step size for the simulation.
            Defaults to None.
    Methods:
        __init__():
            Initializes the FmuProxy instance, setting up the variables and their initial states.
        register_variable(v: Variable):
            Registers a variable with the proxy. If the variable has a start value, it is added
            as an attribute and stored for reset purposes.
        variables() -> List[Variable]:
            Returns a list of all registered variables.
        reset():
            Restores the initial start values of all registered variables, if they were declared.

            Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. Represents a simulation step
