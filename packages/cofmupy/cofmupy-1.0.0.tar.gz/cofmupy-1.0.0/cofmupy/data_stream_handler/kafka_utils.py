    Configuration handler for Kafka connections.

    This dataclass manages Kafka connection parameters, providing default values
    for optional arguments and enforcing required fields. It automatically
    splits the `uri` into `server_url` and `port`, and validates field types
    and allowed values after initialization (i.e. after applying default values).

    Attributes:
        topic (str): Kafka topic to subscribe/publish to. Required.
        uri (str): Connection URI in the format "server_url:port". Required.
        variable (str): Name of the variable associated with the Kafka stream. Required.
        group_id (str): Kafka consumer group ID. Required.
        server_url (str): Extracted server URL from `uri`. Initialized post-init.
        port (str): Extracted port from `uri`. Initialized post-init.
        timeout (float): Timeout in seconds for Kafka operations. Defaults to 0.1.
        interpolation (str): Method used for data interpolation. Defaults to "previous".
        auto_offset_reset (str): Offset reset strategy for Kafka consumer. Defaults to "earliest".
            Allowed values: "earliest", "latest", "none".
        enable_auto_commit (bool): Whether to automatically commit offsets. Defaults to True.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `uri` is malformed, `port` is not numeric, `timeout` is negative,
                    `auto_offset_reset` is invalid, or `interpolation` is not supported.

    Manages a background thread to consume messages from a Kafka topic.

    This class wraps a Kafka consumer (e.g., from `confluent_kafka`) and runs
    a separate thread to continuously poll messages. Incoming messages are
    processed using a callback function provided by the user. The thread can
    run for a limited lifetime or indefinitely.

    Attributes:
        consumer: A Kafka consumer object that handles message fetching.
        callback: A function that is called for each message received.
        thread_lifetime (float): Maximum lifetime of the thread in seconds.
            If None or 0, the thread runs indefinitely.
        running (bool): Flag indicating whether the consuming thread is active.
        thread (threading.Thread): The background thread running the consume loop.
        start_time (float): Timestamp when the thread started, used to track lifetime.

    Methods:
        start(): Start the consuming thread.
        stop(): Gracefully stop the consuming thread.
        _consume_loop(): Internal method running the main polling loop.
