## 👋 About CoFmuPy

CoFmuPy is a Python library designed for rapid prototyping of digital twins through
the co-simulation of Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs).
It offers advanced master coordination features, such as solving algebraic loops between
FMUs and managing the interaction between various simulation components. This library
provides a seamless interface to orchestrate complex physics simulations and handle the
data exchange between FMUs.

The documentation is available online:
[https://irt-saint-exupery.github.io/CoFmuPy](https://irt-saint-exupery.github.io/CoFmuPy)

## 🐾 Installation

CoFmuPy is available on PyPI and can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install cofmupy
```

## 🐍 Key Keatures

CoFmuPy provides a Python interface (with a graphical user interface under development) for configuring and running co-simulations of FMI-based systems, with a focus on coordinating interacting FMUs within complex digital twin architectures.

A high-level API allows users to easily define, execute, and visualize digital twins scenarios, while still enabling more advanced control when needed.

Building on the [FMPy library](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy) as an FMI-compliant execution backend, CoFmuPy focuses on system-level co-simulation capabilities and advanced coordination logic. In particular, CoFmuPy provides the following key features:

- **Advanced master coordination for coupled FMUs**: Native master algorithms orchestrate the execution of multiple interacting FMUs, ensuring coherent time advancement and stable system-level simulation across heterogeneous subsystems. Cyclic dependencies between FMUs (algebraic loops) are automatically detected and resolved using fixed-point strategies, supporting both Jacobi and Gauss–Seidel co-simulation schemes, with or without rollback. This enables the simulation of tightly coupled systems without manual intervention or model restructuring.

- **Explicit data exchange and synchronization mechanisms**: CoFmuPy provides fine-grained control over data routing, synchronization, and signal propagation between FMUs, as well as between FMUs and external data sources or sinks.

- **Native integration of Python and AI components**: Python-based models (e.g., machine learning or control logic) can be directly integrated into the co-simulation loop without immediate FMU export while still being FMI-compliant, enabling full integration of AI frameworks.

- **Declarative and reproducible configuration**: Co-simulation systems are fully defined through a structured JSON configuration file, making experiments easy to reproduce, modify, and extend.

- **Graphical interface (coming soon)**: A user-friendly graphical interface will enable drag-and-drop system construction, FMU interconnection, remote interfaces configuration, algorithm selection, and co-simulation control.
