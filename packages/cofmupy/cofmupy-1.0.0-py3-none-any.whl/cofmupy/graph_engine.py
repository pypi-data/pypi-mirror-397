"""
The GraphEngine class is responsible for creating a graph representation of the
co-simulation diagram.

The graph consists of nodes representing either FMUs or symbolic nodes (data sources and
sinks). Directed edges represent the connections between FMUs or between an FMU and a
source/sink. The class provides methods to compute the execution order of nodes, and to
plot the graph (using GraphPlotter class). The execution order, determined by strongly
connected components (SCCs), is used by the Master algorithm to schedule the simulation steps.

The GraphEngine uses the NetworkX library to build and manipulate the graph.
