Module for handling data streams. This module contains the base class for data stream
handlers and the child classes for different types of data stream handlers.

The data stream handlers are used to read data from different sources, such as CSV
files, Kafka topics, or dictionaries.

The base class `BaseDataStreamHandler` defines the interface for the data stream
handlers. The child classes implement the specific logic to read data from the
different sources.
