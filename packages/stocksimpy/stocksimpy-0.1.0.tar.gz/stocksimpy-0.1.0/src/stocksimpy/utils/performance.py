class Performance:
    """
    Compute performance and risk metrics for a backtest execution.

    This class wraps a completed Backtester instance to calculate risk-adjusted
    returns, volatility, drawdown, and other common performance statistics. All
    metrics are computed from the portfolio's value history and trade log.

    Parameters
    ----------
    backtester : Backtester
        A completed Backtester instance with an executed portfolio. The portfolio's
        value_history and trade_log will be used to compute metrics.
    risk_free_rate : float, optional
        Annual risk-free rate used for Sharpe ratio and other risk-adjusted
        calculations. Expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.02 for 2%). Default is 0.02.

    Attributes
    ----------
    backtester : Backtester
        Reference to the underlying Backtester instance.
    portfolio : Portfolio
        The portfolio object from the backtester.
    symbol : str
        Ticker symbol being analyzed.
    risk_free_rate : float
        Annual risk-free rate for calculations.

    Notes
    -----
    - All return metrics are expressed as decimals (e.g., 0.15 for 15%).
    - Volatility and Sharpe ratio are annualized using the observed trading days
      per year in the portfolio's value history.
    - Drawdown is expressed as a negative decimal (e.g., -0.25 for -25%).
    - Metrics assume that the backtester has already been executed; results may
      be incorrect or zero if the backtest produced no trades or value history.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> bt = Backtester('AAPL', stock_data, strategy)
    >>> bt.run_backtest_fixed()
    >>> perf = Performance(bt, risk_free_rate=0.02)
    >>> report = perf.generate_risk_report()
    >>> print(f"Sharpe Ratio: {report['Sharpe Ratio']:.2f}")

        Returns

        Notes

        -----
        - The calculation assumes a 365.25-day year to account for leap years.

        Notes

        - If the portfolio has fewer than 2 entries or spans zero years,
          the method returns 252.
        - Formula: ``total_trading_days / total_years``

        Calculate the maximum drawdown during the backtest period.

        Maximum drawdown is the peak-to-trough decline from the highest

        cumulative loss experienced by the strategy.

        -------
        float
            Maximum drawdown as a negative decimal. For example, -0.25 represents

            value history is empty.

        Notes
        -----
        - Formula: ``min((value - cummax(value)) / cummax(value))``

    def calc_sharpe_ratio(self) -> float:
        """
        Calculate the annualized Sharpe ratio.

        The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted return by comparing the excess
        daily return (above the risk-free rate) to the standard deviation of
        daily returns. Higher Sharpe ratios indicate better risk-adjusted
        performance.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            Annualized Sharpe ratio. A typical range is 0 to 3, with values
            above 1.0 generally considered good and above 2.0 excellent.
            Returns 0.0 if daily returns are empty or have zero volatility.

        Notes
        -----
        - The calculation uses the dynamic annualization factor from
          ``_get_annualized_trading_days()`` to adapt to the backtest period.
        - Formula:

            (mean_daily_excess_return / daily_volatility) * sqrt(annualization_factor)

        - The risk-free rate is converted to a daily rate before computation.
        - Sharpe ratios above 1.0 typically indicate strong risk-adjusted returns.

        --------
        >>> perf = Performance(bt)
        >>> sharpe = perf.calc_sharpe_ratio()
