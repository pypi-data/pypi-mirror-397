Poison is a damaging ailment that deals Chaos damage over time. In PoE2, poison has a
DEFAULT STACK LIMIT OF 1 - this is a MAJOR change from PoE1 where poison could stack
infinitely.

Multiple poison instances CAN exist on a target, each with their own duration, but only
the highest damage instance(s) will actually deal damage, up to your stack limit.

To make poison builds work in PoE2, you need sources that increase your poison stack
limit, such as the Escalating Poison Support gem.

1. You deal physical and/or chaos damage with a hit that has poison chance
2. If poison is applied, it deals 20% of the hit's combined physical + chaos damage per second
3. Base poison duration is 2 seconds
4. DEFAULT STACK LIMIT: 1 - only the strongest poison deals damage
5. Multiple poisons can exist but only up to your stack limit actually deal damage
6. Poison damage BYPASSES Energy Shield (damages life directly)
7. Escalating Poison Support adds +1 to your poison stack limit

Poison DPS per stack = 20% of (Physical + Chaos damage of the hit)

- Poison DPS = 0.20 x 1500 = 300 chaos DPS
- Over 2 seconds = 600 total chaos damage
- If you apply 5 poisons, only the STRONGEST ONE deals damage

Bleed (Bleeding) is a damaging ailment that deals physical damage over time.

            short_description="Additive (increased) vs Multiplicative (more) damage scaling",
            detailed_explanation="""
This is THE most important damage scaling concept in Path of Exile.

- "Increased" modifiers are ADDITIVE with each other
- "More" modifiers are MULTIPLICATIVE with everything

Understanding this is crucial for optimizing damage.
""",
            how_it_works="""
1. All "Increased" modifiers add together first
   - 50% + 30% + 20% increased = 100% increased = 2.0x multiplier

2. All "More" modifiers multiply separately
   - 30% more x 20% more = 1.3 x 1.2 = 1.56x multiplier

3. Order of operations:
   Base Damage x (1 + Sum of Increased) x (More 1) x (More 2) x ...

The KEY insight: If you already have lots of "increased" damage,
adding more "increased" has diminishing returns. "More" multipliers
always give their full multiplicative benefit.
""",
            calculation_formula="""
Final Damage = Base x (1 + TotalIncreased%) x More1 x More2 x More3...

Example:
- Base: 100 damage
- Increased: 50% + 30% + 20% = 100% increased
- More: 30% more, 20% more
- Calculation: 100 x 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.2 = 312 damage

Why More is powerful:
- If you have 200% increased, adding 100% more = 3.0x -> 4.0x (33% gain)
- Adding 50% more instead = 3.0x x 1.5 = 4.5x (50% gain!)

Critical strikes deal bonus damage based on your critical strike multiplier.
In PoE2, the base crit multiplier is +100% (so crits deal 200% damage).

IMPORTANT: In PoE2, critical strikes do NOT guarantee ailments like they
did in PoE1. Crits just deal more damage, which indirectly helps ailment
application through the threshold system.
""",

2. If successful, damage is multiplied by your crit multiplier
3. Base crit multiplier in PoE2 is +100% (200% damage)

5. Crit chance is capped at 100%
6. Crit multiplier has no cap
""",

Critical Hit Damage = Base Damage x (1 + Crit Multiplier)

Example:
- Base: 1000 damage
