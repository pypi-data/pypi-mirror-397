# DPSimulation.ipynb

This notebook runs a Langevin simulation for a single choice of linear coefficient $a$ and for a single choice of grid size. In constrast to the [DPSimulationDirect.ipynb](dp-DPSimulationDirect-ipynb-reference.md) notebook, here the Python codes is largely abstracted out into [langevin.dp.simulation.Simulation][langevin.dp.simulation.Simulation].
