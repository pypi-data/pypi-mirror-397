The  [`langevin` package ](https://pypi.org/project/langevin/) provides software tools to integrate a time-dependent density field described by Langevin equations of directed-percolation type. It can be extended to solve Langevin equations of absorbing phase transition (APT) type.

!!! note "This is a work in progress"
    `langevin` is under active development as part of a research effort.
    If you are interested in using it, or even better, interested in
    collaborating in its development, please contact the maintainer cstarkjp@gmail.com.
    
[Directed percolation (DP)](references.md) is the _type example_ of a non-equilibrium, absorbing phase transition. Its Langevin equation is:
$$
    \partial_t\rho
    =
    a \rho
    -
    b \rho^2
    +
    D \nabla^2 \rho
    +
    \eta\sqrt{\rho}\,\xi
$$
where $\rho(\mathbf{x},t)$ is a fluctuating meso-scale field  evolving nonlinearly (with coefficients $a$ and $b$) subject to diffusion (with rate $D$) and multiplicative white noise $\sqrt{\rho}\,\xi(\mathbf{x},t)$ (with amplitude $\eta$).

The `langevin` integrator employs the operator-splitting method originated largely by [Dornic et al (2005)](references.md). The software tools are implemented as a [`pip`-installable Python package](https://pypi.org/project/langevin/) with a C++ core, a set of [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/cstarkjp/Langevin/tree/main/simulation/dp), and related [Python scripts](https://github.com/cstarkjp/Langevin/tree/main/python).
