# cmstp - computer setup

Contains anything related to setting up a new computer (desktop) system.

# Disclaimer - Use at your own risk
This project is currently (12.2025) coded solely by me. As a junior developer, there is probably a lot that can be improved and although I have tested each task, there may be some unforeseen issues. Please use with caution and report any issues you find (see the [contributing](https://github.com/ArturoRoberti/cmstp/blob/main/README.md#contributing) section).

During this project's initial development, I recommend using it solely on fresh machines.

# Installation
## Prerequisites
### Ubuntu 24.04+
We recommend installing `pipx` via apt:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx
```
### Older Ubuntu Versions
We recommend installing `pipx` via `pip`:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip && python3 -m pip install --user pipx
```
> **NOTE**: The installation of `pipx` via `pip` (as opposed to `apt`) is recommended on older versions, as the `apt` version is often outdated.

### MacOS
Not supported yet.

### Windows
Not supported yet.

## Main Installation
Then, install `cmstp` via `pipx`:
```bash
pipx install cmstp
```

# Usage
## Pre-Setup
We recommend setting up the following before running the main installation/configuration tasks:
- Configuring SSH keys for git (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) - some tasks may require cloning private repositories
- Disabling Secure Boot (e.g. for installing NVIDIA drivers)

You can use the provided helper to guide you through these steps:
```bash
cmstp pre-setup [-s] [-g]
```

The helper also provides further possible manual setup steps for configuring fresh systems.

> **NOTE**: You may also look up the general instructions for creating SSH keys [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key).

## Main Installations/Configurations
To use default installations/configurations, simply use (without any flags):
```
cmstp setup [-h] [-t TASKS [TASKS ...]] [-f CONFIG_FILE] [-d CONFIG_DIRECTORY] [-p] [-v]
```

To use custom config installation/configuration config files, use (flag shorthand: `-d`)
```bash
cmstp setup --config-directory </path/to/configs/ | git_url>
```
where `/path/to/configs/` is a directory containing multiple txt/json(c)/yaml/... configuration files (to be used by tasks as defined in this repo's `config/default.yaml` file) following this package's default `config/` directory. Each file in that directory should have the same name and structure as in the default. We **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** saving a personalized config directory as a git repository and providing the git URL instead of a local path. The repository will be cloned and used for the configurations. For more details and examples of configs, see [this README](https://github.com/ArturoRoberti/cmstp/blob/main/src/cmstp/config/README.md).

To easily specify multiple tasks to be run, use (flag shorthand: `-f`)
```bash
cmstp setup --config-file /path/to/config.yaml
```
where the config file should be a yaml file following the structure of the `config/enabled.yaml` file in this package. That config file contains detailed explanations. Should a relative path be provided, the file will first be searched for locally and then in the config directory. Should a git reference be provided, the repository will be cloned and the file searched for there, as specified in the git reference.

To simply enable tasks with their default configurations, use (flag shorthand: `-t`)
```bash
cmstp setup --tasks TASK1 TASK2 ...
```
where `TASK1`, `TASK2`, ... are the task names as specified in the `config/enabled.yaml` file in this package. Task arguments may optionally be passed via colon separation, e.g. `--tasks task1:arg1:arg2 task2:arg1`, in which case they will override any existing arguments for those tasks. Note that the precedence for any fields passed to tasks is as follows: `CLI tasks` > `config file` > `default config`.

Further options are
- `--enable-all` to enable all tasks (takes precedence over config file)
- `--enable-dependencies` to automatically enable dependencies of enabled tasks (takes precedence over config file)
- `--disable-preparation` to disable updating/upgrading apt beforehand (not recommended)
- `-v, --verbose` to enable verbose logging

Logs are saved to `~/.cmstp/logs/<timestamp>/`.

## Note on Git References
When providing a git reference (for `--config-directory`, `--config-file` or anywhere else), the format is as follows:
```bash
<git_url>[?<param>=<value>&...]
```

with supported query parameters:
- branch: branch name
- commit: commit hash (overrides branch if both provided)
- path: subdirectory path within the repo
- depth: clone depth (integer)

Examples are
```
https://github.com/user/repo.git
https://github.com/user/repo.git?branch=main
https://github.com/user/repo.git?commit=abc123&branch=dev&depth=1
```

# Possible Future Features
- Add uninstallations/deconfigurations and seprate configurations from installations. That could result in multiple entrypoints (instead of the current single `cmstp setup`):
    - `cmstp install` - for installations only
    - `cmstp configure` - for configurations only
    - `cmstp uninstall` - for uninstallations only
    - Possibly, a `cmstp deconfigure` for deconfigurations only
- Setup Browser Bookmarks
- Setup Autocompletions
