LocalSiteMap is an open-source Python package designed for generating sitemaps from local files. It tracks `HTML` and `HTM` files, and generates complete sitemaps for the root website, including directories.

### Changes in version 1.0.2:
- Removed the unnecessary `install_requires` from the `setup.py` as the package utilizes none of the required packages.

### Changes in version 1.0.1:
- Added `show_progress` boolean to print out mapping progress, pages mapped, and files found.

### Changes in version 1.0.0:
- Added initial package code, with automatic directory crawling to generate the `sitemap.xml` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `LocalSiteMap` crawls any directory found in the root folder, be sure to add exclusions for important directories, or hidden/resource/file directories.

## Installation

You can install LocalSiteMap using pip:

```bash
pip install localsitemap
```

## Supported Python Versions

LocalSiteMap supports the following Python versions:

- Python 3.6
- Python 3.7
- Python 3.8
- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11/Later (Preferred)

Please ensure that you have one of these Python versions installed before using LocalSiteMap. LocalSiteMap may not work as expected on lower versions of Python than the supported.

## Features

- **Directory Crawling**: `LocalSiteMap` automatically crawls all subdirectories and files under the root directory, recursively adding them to your sitemap.
- **Automatic Last Modified Checks**: The package also automatically checks when the file has last been modified when adding it to the sitemap.
- - **Customizable**: You can customize the sitemap generation process by excluding specific directories or files.
- **Easy to Use**: With just a few lines of code, you can generate a complete sitemap for your local website.
- **Open Source**: LocalSiteMap is open source, allowing you to inspect, modify, and contribute to the code.

## Usage

### Generating a sitemap

```python
from localsitemap import generate_sitemap

# Root site directory
root_directory = r"path/to/your/website/directory"

# Domain of your website (where it is hosted)
base_url_of_your_website = "https://example.com"

# List of file paths or directories to exclude from the sitemap
excluded = ["auth", "forms", "template.html", "media", ".git", ".vscode", "node_modules"]  # Example exclusions

# Generate the sitemap
generate_sitemap(root_directory, base_url_of_your_website, "sitemap.xml", excluded, show_progress=True)
print("Sitemap generated in sitemap.xml")
```
