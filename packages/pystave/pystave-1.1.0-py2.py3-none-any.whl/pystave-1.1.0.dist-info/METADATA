This is a Python program that helps you practice sight-reading by flashing up
notes on a stave (treble and/or bass clef). You will have a certain number of
seconds to correctly identify each note. With the appropriate MIDI adapter
plugged in, the `-m` command-line option (see below) allows you to respond
using your instrument.  Failing that, respond with keys `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`,
`E`, `F`, or `G` on your computer keyboard. In either case, press `Q` to quit
the program.

Install with `python -m pip install pystave`. This will install both the
`pystave` package and, if you do not already have it, its dependency `pygame`.

You can run the game from the command-line with `python -m pystave ` followed
by whatever command-line options you want.

On Windows, the simplest way to set it up is to find `NoteTrainer.exe` in the
`Scripts` directory of your Python distribution (or virtual environment), and
make a shortcut to that. In the "Target" field of the "Properties" dialog for
the shortcut, you can add any command-line options you want to add. Launch the
game from that shortcut.

The game's command-line options are as follows:

	 -m N             Listen to midi channel `N` (default 0, meaning no midi
	--midichannel=N   input). It may take some trial and error to find the
	                  number that corresponds to the correct channel of your
	                  USB MIDI adapter.
	
	 -s X             Scale the size of the window by factor `X` (default 1).
	--size=X
	
	
	 -t T             Set the time limit for responding to `T` seconds
	--timelimit=T     (default 4).

	
	
	 -c C             Include clef `C`. Possible values are `bass` and
	--clef=C          `treble`. The default is to test both (choose randomly
	                  each time around) which is equivalent to supplying
	                  `-c treble -c bass` or `-c bass,treble`.
