This is a Python program that helps you practice sight-reading by flashing up
notes on a stave (treble and/or bass clef). You will have a certain number of
seconds to correctly identify each note. With the appropriate MIDI adapter plugged
in, the `-m` command-line option (see below) allows you to respond using your
instrument.  Failing that, respond with keys `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, or `G`
on your computer keyboard. In either case, press `Q` to quit the program.

Install with `python -m pip install pystave`. This will install both the `pystave`
package and, if you do not already have it, its dependency `pygame`.

You can run the game from the command-line with `python -m pystave`.

On Windows, the simplest way to use it is to find `NoteTrainer.exe` in the `Scripts`
directory of your Python distribution (or virtual environment), and make a shortcut
to that. In the "Target" field of the "Properties" dialog for the shortcut, you can add
any command-line options you want to add. Launch the game from that shortcut.

Command-line options are as follows:

	 -m N             Listen to midi channel #N  (default 0, meaning no midi input).
	--midichannel=N   It may take some trial and error to find the number that
	                  corresponds to the correct channel of your USB MIDI adapter.
	
	 -s X             Scale the size of the window by factor X (default 1).
	--size=X
	
	
	 -t T             Set the time limit for responding to T seconds (default 4).
	--timelimit=T
	
	
	 -c C             Include clef C. Possible values are "bass" and "treble".
	--clef=C          The default is to test both (choose randomly each time
	                  around) which is equivalent to supplying -c treble -c bass
	                  or -c bass,treble .
