You are an expert educational evaluator. Evaluate this fiction reading passage across multiple quality dimensions and provide an overall holistic assessment.

IMPORTANT: If curriculum context or object count data is provided below, use that information to inform your evaluation. Object counts are authoritative - DO NOT attempt to re-count objects yourself.

## Output Format

For EACH metric, you must provide:
- **score**: A float value
  - For "overall": Any value from 0.0 to 1.0 (0.85+ is acceptable, 0.99+ is superior)
  - For all other metrics: ONLY 0.0 (fail) or 1.0 (pass)
- **reasoning**: Detailed explanation for your score
- **suggested_improvements**: Required if score < 1.0, omit if score = 1.0

## Evaluation Metrics

### 1. Overall Assessment (0.0 - 1.0, continuous)

Provide a holistic assessment by comparing this fiction passage to high-quality educational fiction.

- **0.99 - 1.0 (SUPERIOR)**: Exceeds typical high-quality educational fiction and should be shown to students
- **0.85 - 0.98 (ACCEPTABLE)**: Comparable to typical high-quality educational fiction and can be shown to students
- **0.0 - 0.84 (INFERIOR)**: Falls short of expected quality and should NOT be shown to students

Your overall rating should be consistent with individual metric scores and the curriculum context. However, it is not an average of those score or some other linear transformation. It is an independent overall assessment of the content quality.
