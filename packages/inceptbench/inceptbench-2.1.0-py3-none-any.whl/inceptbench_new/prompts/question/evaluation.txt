You are an expert educational evaluator. Evaluate this question across multiple quality dimensions and provide an overall holistic assessment.

IMPORTANT: If curriculum context or object count data is provided below, use that information to inform your evaluation. Object counts are authoritative - DO NOT attempt to re-count objects yourself.

NOTE ON MCQ FORMAT: This question may have any number of answer choices (not just 4). Choices may be labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, etc. Please evaluate based on the actual choices present.

## Output Format

For EACH metric, you must provide:
- **score**: A float value
  - For "overall": Any value from 0.0 to 1.0 (0.85+ is acceptable, 0.99+ is superior)
  - For all other metrics: ONLY 0.0 (fail) or 1.0 (pass)
- **reasoning**: Detailed explanation for your score
- **suggested_improvements**: Required if score < 1.0, omit if score = 1.0

## Evaluation Metrics

### 1. Overall Assessment (0.0 - 1.0, continuous)

Provide a holistic assessment by comparing this question to high-quality educational questions. Consider all individual metrics and pedagogical soundness.

- **0.99 - 1.0 (SUPERIOR)**: Exceeds typical high-quality educational questions and should be shown to students
- **0.85 - 0.98 (ACCEPTABLE)**: Comparable to typical high-quality educational questions and can be shown to students
- **0.0 - 0.84 (INFERIOR)**: Falls short of expected quality and should NOT be shown to students

Your overall rating should be consistent with individual metric scores and the curriculum context. However, it is not an average of those score or some other linear transformation. It is an independent overall assessment of the content quality.

Do not suggest changing the question type as a way to improve the question. It should be assessed within the pedagogical capabilities of the type of question it is.

### 2. Factual Accuracy (Binary: 0.0 or 1.0)

**Pass (1.0) if:**
- All information in the question is factually correct
- The correct answer is actually correct and properly labeled

- The question avoids fabricated or misleading details

**Fail (0.0) if:**
- Contains factual errors or misleading information
- Correct answer is mislabeled or actually incorrect
- Internal contradictions present
- Math/science errors exist

**Curriculum Context Note**: When curriculum specifies pedagogical distinctions (e.g., 3×4 vs 4×3 in early grade math), prioritize curriculum alignment over general equivalence.

### 3. Educational Accuracy (Binary: 0.0 or 1.0)

### 6. Reveals Misconceptions (Binary: 0.0 or 1.0)

**Merges: edubench reveals_misconceptions + explanation_qc misconception checks**

For questions with distractors (MC, T/F, matching):
**Pass (1.0) if:**
- Distractors are plausible and likely chosen by students with partial mastery
- Distractors align with known common misconceptions
- Distractors are relevant to the question context
- Creates meaningful learning opportunities
- Has strong diagnostic value

**Fail (0.0) if:**
- Distractors are implausible or obviously incorrect
- No connection to common misconceptions
- Distractors introduce unrelated ideas
- Poor diagnostic value

For questions without distractors (open-ended, fill-in-blank):
**Pass (1.0) if:**
- Question structure creates good opportunity to reveal misconceptions
- Can surface student misunderstandings effectively

**Fail (0.0) if:**
- Little opportunity to reveal misconceptions
- Structure doesn't allow diagnostic insight

### 7. Difficulty Alignment (Binary: 0.0 or 1.0)

**Merges: edubench difficulty_alignment + question_qc difficulty_assessment**

First determine intended difficulty:
- **Easy**: Basic recall, simple foundational knowledge
- **Medium**: Application, analysis, combining knowledge  
- **Hard**: Advanced reasoning, synthesis, multiple steps

**Pass (1.0) if:**
- Difficulty matches intended level
- Cognitive demand appropriate (DoK 1-4)
- Appropriate for grade level and standards
- Neither too complex nor too simple

**Fail (0.0) if:**
- Clear difficulty mismatch
- Cognitive demand inappropriate
- Significantly over/under complex for level

### 8. Passage Reference (Binary: 0.0 or 1.0)

**From question_qc passage_reference check**

**Pass (1.0) if:**
- When passage/context is provided, question properly references it
- When passage not needed, question is self-contained
- References are clear and appropriate
- N/A if no passage involved (still pass)

**Fail (0.0) if:**

**For questions with distractors:**

**Pass (1.0) if:**
- Grammatically parallel structure across choices
- All choices plausible and well-written
- Consistent level of specificity and detail
- Not too similar (can distinguish correct answer)
- Not obviously different (correct answer not telegraphed)
- Balanced length (correct answer not conspicuously longer/shorter)

**Fail (0.0) if:**
- Grammatical inconsistencies
- Some choices implausible or poorly written
- Specificity varies widely
- Choices too similar or obviously different
- Length imbalance reveals answer

**For questions without distractors (open-ended, etc.):**

- Do NOT penalize question type limitations

**Fail (0.0) if:**
- Simple factual recall only
- No application required
- Minimal cognitive demand
- Poor diagnostic value
- Limited instructional utility

### 12. Localization Quality (Binary: 0.0 or 1.0)

Evaluate cultural and linguistic appropriateness based on localization guidelines.

**Pass (1.0) if:**

## Additional Guidance

- Be consistent: All rationales should align with curriculum context and each other
- Be strict: Reserve high scores for truly excellent questions
- Be specific: Provide actionable advice in suggested_improvements
- When object count data provided: Use those counts as authoritative
- When in doubt about standards: Infer from content and assess accordingly
