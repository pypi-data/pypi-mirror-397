The Everglades is a natural region of tropical wetlands in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Florida, comprising the southern half of a large drainage basin within the Neotropical realm. The ecosystem it forms is not presently found anywhere else on earth.

Indigenous people of the Everglades include the Calusa, Tequesta, Jeaga, Ais, and Mayaimi. These tribes adapted to the wet environment, building shell mounds and canals.

The Calusa were known as the "Shell Indians" because they used shells for tools, jewelry, and to build mounds. They controlled most of south Florida.

The Seminole people migrated into Florida in the 18th century. They adapted to the Everglades environment during the Seminole Wars, using the difficult terrain to their advantage against US troops.

Today, the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes still live in the Everglades region, working to preserve their culture and the environment.
