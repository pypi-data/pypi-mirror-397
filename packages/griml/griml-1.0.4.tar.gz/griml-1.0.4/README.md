The **GrIML** (Investigating Greenland's ice marginal lakes under a changing climate) processing package for classifying water bodies from satellite imagery using a multi-sensor, multi-method remote sensing approach. This workflow is used for the production of the [Greenland ice-marginal lake inventory series](https://doi.org/10.22008/FK2/MBKW9N), as part of the [ESA GrIML project](https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/griml/). This repository also holds all project-related materials.


## Installation

The GrIML Python package can be installed using pip: 

```
$ pip install griml
```

Or cloned from the Github repository: 

```
$ git clone git@github.com:GEUS-Glaciology-and-Climate/GrIML.git
$ cd GrIML
$ pip install .
```

Full documentation and tutorials are available at GrIML's [readthedocs](https://griml.readthedocs.io)


## Workflow outline

**GrIML** proposes to examine ice marginal lake changes across Greenland using a multi-sensor and multi-method remote sensing approach to better address their influence on sea level contribution forecasting.

Ice-marginal lakes are detected using a remote sensing approach, based on offline workflows developed within the [ESA Glaciers CCI](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/7ea7540135f441369716ef867d217519") (Option 6, An Inventory of Ice-Marginal Lakes in Greenland) ([How et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83509-1)). Initial classifications are performed using Google Earth Engine, with the scripts available [here](https://github.com/GEUS-Glaciology-and-Climate/GrIML/tree/main/gee_scripts). Lake extents are defined through a multi-sensor approach using:

- Multi-spectral indices classification from Sentinel-2 optical imagery
- Backscatter classification from Sentinel-1 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) imagery
- Sink detection from ArcticDEM digital elevation models 

Post-processing of these classifications is performed using the **GrIML** Python package, including raster-to-vector conversion, filtering, merging, metadata population, and statistical analysis.
