## Dataset Splitter

This utility splits an image dataset into train, validation, and test subsets while preserving the class folder structure.

## Description

The split_dataset function takes a list of source folders, where each folder represents a class containing image files. The function randomly splits the images into training, validation, and testing sets and copies them into a new output directory.

The resulting directory structure looks like this:

output_folder/
  train/
    class_name/
  val/
    class_name/
  test/
    class_name/

The split is random but reproducible due to a fixed random seed.

## Supported Image Formats

.jpg
.jpeg
.png
.bmp
.gif
.tiff
.webp

## Usage

from dataset_splitter import split_dataset

source_folders = [
    "data/class_1",
    "data/class_2"
]

output_folder = "dataset_split"

split_dataset(
    source_folders=source_folders,
    output_folder=output_folder,
    train_ratio=0.7,
    val_ratio=0.15,
    test_ratio=0.15,
    seed=42
)

## Function Signature

split_dataset(
    source_folders: list[str],
    output_folder: str,
    train_ratio: float = 0.7,
    val_ratio: float = 0.15,
    test_ratio: float = 0.15,
    seed: int = 42
)

## Parameters

source_folders
List of paths to class directories containing images.

output_folder
Path to the directory where the split dataset will be saved.

train_ratio
Fraction of images used for training.

val_ratio
Fraction of images used for validation.

test_ratio
Fraction of images used for testing.

seed
Random seed to ensure reproducible splits.

The sum of train_ratio, val_ratio, and test_ratio must equal 1.0.

## Output

Image files are copied, not moved.
Original data remains unchanged.
Class folder names are preserved.
Progress information is printed to the console.

## Requirements

Python 3.8 or newer.
Uses only Python standard library modules.
