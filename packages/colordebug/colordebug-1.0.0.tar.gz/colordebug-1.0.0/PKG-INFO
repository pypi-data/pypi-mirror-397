              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# colordebug - Colorful Debugging Utilities for Python

A powerful, production-ready logging and debugging library for Python with colorful console output, smart log rotation, security features, async support, and **text wrapping** capabilities.

## Features

- 🎨 **Colorful console output** with ANSI colors
- 📝 **Multiple log formats** (Text, JSON)
- 🔒 **Security-first** - automatic sensitive data sanitization
- ⚡ **Async support** for modern web applications
- 🔄 **Smart log rotation** with error preservation
- 📊 **Performance monitoring** with execution timing
- 🛠 **Flexible configuration** for different environments
- 📜 **Text wrapping** for better log readability

## Installation

```bash
pip install colordebug
```

Or copy `colordebug.py` directly into your project.

## Quick Start

```python
from colordebug import *

# Basic usage
info("Application started")
success("Data loaded successfully")
warning("This is a warning")
error("Something went wrong")

# With file logging
enable_file_logging("app.log")
info("This will be logged to file", exp=True)

# With text wrapping (new!)
long_message = "This is a very long message that will be wrapped to multiple lines for better readability."
info(long_message, exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=40)
```

## Core Functions

### Basic Logging

```python
debug("Debug message")
info("Information message")
success("Success message") 
warning("Warning message")
error("Error message")
critical("Critical message")

# With exceptions
try:
    risky_operation()
except Exception as e:
    error("Operation failed", e, exp=True)
```

### Advanced Logging

```python
# Log variable values
log_value("user_count", 42, exp=True)

# Log collections
log_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "Sample data", exp=True)
log_dict({"key": "value"}, "Configuration", exp=True)

# Conditional logging
log_condition(len(users) > 0, "Users found", "No users found", exp=True)
```

### Timing and Performance

```python
# Context manager for timing
with timer("Database query", exp=True):
    results = db.query(...)

# Function decorators
@log_function_call(exp=True)
@log_execution_time(exp=True)
def process_data(data):
    return data * 2
```

## Async Support

```python
import asyncio
from colordebug import *

@alog_function_call(exp=True)
@alog_execution_time(exp=True)
async def fetch_data(url):
    await ainfo(f"Fetching {url}", exp=True)
    
    async with atimer("HTTP request", exp=True):
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    
    await asuccess("Data fetched successfully", exp=True)
    return {"data": "sample"}

# Usage
async def main():
    await fetch_data("https://api.example.com/data")
```

## Text Wrapping (New!)

colordebug now supports automatic text wrapping for better log readability.

### Basic Text Wrapping

```python
from colordebug import *

# Enable text wrapping for long messages
long_message = "This is a very long message that should be wrapped to multiple lines based on the specified width."

# Log with text wrapping (width = 40 characters)
info(long_message, exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=40)

# Log without text wrapping
debug(long_message, exp=True, textwrapping=False)
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Set default text wrapping for all logs
enable_file_logging("app.log", textwrapping=True, wrapint=80)

# Use with different log levels
warning("This is a warning message that will be wrapped", exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=50)
error("This is an error message that will be wrapped", exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=50)

# Use with decorators
@log_function_call(exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=60)
def process_data(data):
    # Function logic here
    pass
```

### Parameters

- `textwrapping` (bool): Enable or disable text wrapping. Default: `False`
- `wrapint` (int): Maximum line width in characters. Default: `80`

### Notes

- Text wrapping only applies to text format logs (not JSON format)
- Wrapping preserves words and breaks at whitespace when possible
- Very long words that exceed the wrap width will be broken as needed

## Security Features

### Sensitive Data Sanitization

```python
from colordebug import *

# Add custom sensitive keys
add_sensitive_keys(['credit_card', 'social_security', 'private_key'])

# Sensitive data is automatically masked
user_data = {
    "username": "john_doe",
    "password": "super_secret",
    "credit_card": "4111-1111-1111-1111",
    "normal_data": "this is safe"
}

log_dict(user_data, "User registration", exp=True)
# Output: password="***", credit_card="***", normal_data="this is safe"
```

**Default sensitive keys:** `password`, `token`, `api_key`, `secret`, `auth_key`, `credential`

## Configuration

### Production Setup

```python
from colordebug import *

setup_production_logging(
    log_file="production.log",
    max_lines=5000,
    preserve_errors=True,
    console_output=False,  # Disable console in production
    log_format='json',     # Use JSON for log aggregation
    sensitive_keys=['jwt_token', 'encryption_key']
)
```

### Manual Configuration

```python
# File logging
enable_file_logging("app.log")
set_max_log_lines(1000)           # Rotate after 1000 lines
enable_error_preservation(True)   # Keep all errors during rotation

# Log format
set_log_format('json')  # or 'text'

# Console control
disable_console_output()  # Only file logging
enable_console_output()   # Restore console output

# Log levels
set_log_level('info')  # debug, info, warning, error, critical
```

## Log Rotation

colordebug includes smart log rotation that preserves error messages:

```python
set_max_log_lines(1000)  # Keep maximum 1000 lines

# Errors and critical messages are never deleted during rotation
enable_error_preservation(True)  # Default behavior
```

### Monitoring

```python
# Get log statistics
stats = get_log_stats()
print(f"Total lines: {stats['total_lines']}")
print(f"Errors: {stats['error_lines']}")
print(f"Critical: {stats['critical_lines']}")

# Manual rotation
force_log_rotation()

# View logs
view_logs(limit=10)  # Show 10 most recent entries
```

## Log Formats

### Text Format (Default)
```
[2024-01-15T10:30:00] [INFO] User logged in successfully
[2024-01-15T10:30:01] [ERROR] Database connection failed: timeout
```

### JSON Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "User logged in successfully"
}
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:01", 
  "level": "ERROR",
  "message": "Database connection failed: timeout"
}
```

## Real-world Examples

### Web Application

```python
from colordebug import *
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
setup_production_logging("api.log", log_format='json', textwrapping=True, wrapint=100)

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
@log_function_call(exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=100)
async def get_user(user_id: int):
    await ainfo(f"Fetching user {user_id}", exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=100)
    
    async with atimer("Database query", exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=100):
        user = await db.users.find_one(user_id)
    
    if not user:
        await awarning(f"User {user_id} not found", exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=100)
        return {"error": "User not found"}
    
    await asuccess(f"User {user_id} retrieved successfully", exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=100)
    return user
```

### Data Processing

```python
from colordebug import *

@log_function_call(exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=80)
@log_execution_time(exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=80)
def process_dataset(data):
    log_value("dataset_size", len(data), exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=80)
    log_value("data_columns", list(data.columns), exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=80)
    
    with timer("Data cleaning", exp=True, textwrapping=True, wrapint=80):
        cleaned_data = clean_data(data)
    
    log_condition(
        len(cleaned_data) > 0,
        "Data cleaning successful - all data has been processed and validated",
        "No data after cleaning - the dataset appears to be empty",
        exp=True,
        textwrapping=True,
        wrapint=80
    )
    
    return cleaned_data
```

- `set_log_format(format_type, textwrapping, wrapint)`
- `add_sensitive_keys(keys, textwrapping, wrapint)`
- `set_max_log_lines(max_lines, textwrapping, wrapint)`

- `setup_production_logging(log_file, max_lines, preserve_errors, console_output, log_format, sensitive_keys, textwrapping, wrapint)`

## Best Practices

1. **Use JSON format in production** for better log aggregation
2. **Disable console output in production** to improve performance
3. **Always enable error preservation** to never lose critical errors
4. **Sanitize sensitive data** before logging user input
5. **Use async functions** in web applications for better performance
6. **Enable text wrapping** for better log readability with `textwrapping=True` and `wrapint=80`
7. **Use appropriate wrap width** based on your logging system (80-120 characters recommended)
