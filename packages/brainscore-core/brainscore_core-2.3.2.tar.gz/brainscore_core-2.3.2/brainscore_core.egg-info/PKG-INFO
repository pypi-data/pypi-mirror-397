Brain-Score is a platform to evaluate computational models of mind and brain function on their match to behavioral and
neural measurements in domains such as vision and language. The intent of Brain-Score is to adopt many (ideally all) the
experimental benchmarks in the field for the purpose of model testing, falsification, and comparison. To that end,
Brain-Score operationalizes experimental data into quantitative benchmarks that any model candidate following
the `BrainModel` interface can be scored on.

See the [Documentation](https://brain-score-core.readthedocs.io) for more details.

Brain-Score is made by and for the community. To contribute,
