# mcp-browser - Product Requirements Document
## Zero-Friction Browser-AI Integration for Developers

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 14, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Target Market:** Web Developers using AI Coding Assistants

---

## Executive Summary

mcp-browser eliminates the friction between browser-based development and AI coding assistants by providing instant, zero-configuration integration that captures browser activity and enables AI-driven debugging, testing, and development workflows.

**The Problem:** Developers waste 30+ minutes daily copying console errors, DOM state, and browser context into AI tools, breaking their flow state and reducing productivity.

**The Solution:** One-command installation that automatically connects any browser to any Claude Code instance, enabling natural language browser control and automated debugging assistance.

**The Outcome:** 60% reduction in context-switching time and 40% faster web application debugging cycles.
