## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.54] - 2025-12-18


## [2.2.53] - 2025-12-18

### Fixed
- **Connection Stability**: Fixed intermittent "No active browser connection" errors for DOM operations
  - Root cause: BrowserService couldn't distinguish browser extension connections from CLI connections
  - DOM commands, screenshots, and content extraction were sometimes routed to CLI connections which can't respond
  - Added `is_extension` tracking to `BrowserConnection` to identify browser extension connections
  - DOM operations (`extract_content`, `capture_screenshot`, `send_dom_command`) now use `require_extension=True`
  - Extension connections are marked when they send `connection_init` handshake
  - This ensures DOM/screenshot operations are always sent to the correct connection

## [2.2.52] - 2025-12-17


## [2.2.51] - 2025-12-17


## [2.2.50] - 2025-12-17


## [2.2.49] - 2025-12-17


## [2.2.48] - 2025-12-16


## [2.2.47] - 2025-12-16


### Fixed
- **Chrome Extension**: Fixed character duplication bug in fill functionality
  - When filling text fields, characters were being doubled (e.g., "mcp-browser" became "mccpp--bbrroowwsseerr")
  - Root cause: `chrome.tabs.sendMessage()` was broadcasting to ALL frames, causing multiple content scripts to type simultaneously
  - Fix: Added `{ frameId: 0 }` option to target only the main frame, preventing duplicate execution in iframes
  - Affects: `background-enhanced.js` dom_command handler and `_sendTabMessage()` helper

## [2.2.46] - 2025-12-16


## [2.2.45] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed race condition causing "No active browser connection" errors
  - When extension reconnects rapidly, old disconnection would delete NEW connection's mapping
  - `BrowserState.remove_connection()` now checks if mapping still points to itself before deleting
  - This was root cause of unstable screenshot/DOM extraction despite extension being connected

## [2.2.44] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- Setup command now auto-opens Chrome extensions page on macOS when extension version mismatch detected
  - After `pipx upgrade`, running `mcp-browser setup` detects stale extension versions
  - On macOS with Chrome running, automatically opens `chrome://extensions/` for easy reload
  - Shows clear version mismatch warning with reload instructions
- Extension now shows browser notification when connected to a newer server version
  - Alerts user to reload extension when server has been upgraded

## [2.2.43] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- MCP mode now falls back to ANY running server if project path doesn't match
  - Claude Code may spawn `mcp-browser mcp` from a different working directory
  - Previously, extension commands failed because daemon couldn't be found
  - Now tries exact project match first, then falls back to any running server

## [2.2.42] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- Server cleanup now checks ALL PIDs on a port, not just the first one
  - `lsof -ti :port` returns both clients (Chrome) and servers (mcp-browser)
  - Previously only checked first PID, which could be Chrome Helper, not mcp-browser
  - Now iterates through all PIDs to find the actual mcp-browser server

## [2.2.41] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- MCP tools now use the correct server port for the current project
  - Previously, `PortResolver._get_daemon_port()` returned the first running server found
  - Now it matches server's `project_path` to current working directory
  - Fixes issue where MCP tools from project A would control browser in project B

## [2.2.40] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- Setup now cleans up ALL duplicate servers for current project before starting
  - Previously, running setup multiple times could accumulate orphan servers (e.g., mcp-browser on 8851, 8854)
  - Added `cleanup_project_servers()` that scans port range 8851-8899 and kills any servers running from the same project directory
  - Uses `lsof -a -p PID -d cwd -Fn` to detect process working directory for accurate orphan detection

## [2.2.39] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- Setup ALWAYS copies fresh extension files on every run
  - Previously only synced manifest.json but kept old JavaScript files
  - Now copies all extension files from package source to ensure code is updated
- Updated all extension manifest versions to 2.2.39

## [2.2.38] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- Broken import in display.py that caused CLI to fail when installed via pip
  - Changed `from src._version` to `from mcp_browser._version`

## [2.2.37] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- Setup command now always syncs extension version even if extension already installed
  - Previously, extension version would stay stale after package updates
  - Extracted `sync_extension_version()` to dedicated extension utility module
  - Added 6 unit tests for version sync functionality

## [2.2.36] - 2025-12-16


## [2.2.35] - 2025-12-16


## [2.2.34] - 2025-12-16

  - Replaced deprecated `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction` with `inspect.iscoroutinefunction`
  - Fixed `websockets.exceptions.ConnectionRefused` deprecation (now OSError)
- Made `py-mcp-installer` import optional to prevent test failures when not installed
- Updated Makefile to prefer `.venv/bin/python` over system Python

### Removed
- Removed outdated `test_implementation.py` that tested deprecated ScreenshotService

## [2.2.31] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed

  - Changed from eager import to lazy import pattern using `__getattr__`
  - Eliminates warning when running `python -m src.cli.main`

### Changed

  - Removed outdated `docs/CHANGELOG.md` duplicate
  - Moved `BUILD_TRACKING.md` to `docs/developer/`
  - Removed legacy `Makefile.legacy`
  - Added `chunk-graph.json` to `.gitignore`

## [2.2.30] - 2025-12-15

### Added
- Playwright cache cleanup step in quickstart wizard
- Auto-detects legacy Playwright browser cache and offers to remove it
- Shows cache size and explains why cleanup is safe (Playwright removed in v2.2.29)

## [2.2.29] - 2025-12-15

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed Playwright dependency entirely to fix catastrophic memory leak
- Removed `screenshot_service.py` - Playwright-based screenshot service
- Removed CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) support from `browser_controller.py`
- Removed Playwright browser installation from quickstart wizard
- Removed Playwright validation checks

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed Mach port exhaustion on macOS caused by Playwright browser instances
  - Playwright browser instances were creating Mach ports for IPC
  - Ports weren't being cleaned up when browsers close
  - Accumulated in launchservicesd until system hit port limit
  - Chrome crash handler crashed repeatedly (87 times in 90 seconds)
  - Eventually triggered pkill affecting other apps (iTerm2)

### Changed
- Screenshots now work exclusively via browser extension (not Playwright)
- Browser control limited to extension and AppleScript fallback (no CDP)

### Note
Users upgrading from previous versions should run `mcp-browser uninstall --playwright` to clean up Playwright browser cache and free disk space (~100MB+).

## [2.2.28] - 2025-12-15

### Added
- Auto-detect daemon port for all MCP tools - port parameter now optional
- Warn and auto-correct when CDP port 9222 is mistakenly used
- Cache resolved daemon port for performance
