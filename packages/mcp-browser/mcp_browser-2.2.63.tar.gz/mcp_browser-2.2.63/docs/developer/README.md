# Developer docs

This folder contains maintainer-focused documentation and implementation notes.

## Start here

- Maintainer guide: `docs/developer/DEVELOPER.md`
- Release automation: `docs/developer/RELEASE_AUTOMATION_SUMMARY.md`

## Notes on freshness

Some files in this directory are historical implementation summaries and may reference older port ranges or legacy MCP tool names. For the current MCP tool surface, use `docs/reference/MCP_TOOLS.md`.
