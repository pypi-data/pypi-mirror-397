# Project Memory Configuration

This project uses KuzuMemory for intelligent context management.

## Project Information
- **Path**: /Users/masa/Projects/mcp-browser
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Unknown

## Memory Integration

KuzuMemory is configured to enhance all AI interactions with project-specific context.

### Available Commands:
- `kuzu-memory enhance <prompt>` - Enhance prompts with project context
- `kuzu-memory learn <content>` - Store learning from conversations (async)
- `kuzu-memory recall <query>` - Query project memories
- `kuzu-memory stats` - View memory statistics

### MCP Tools Available:
When interacting with Claude Desktop, the following MCP tools are available:
- **kuzu_enhance**: Enhance prompts with project memories
- **kuzu_learn**: Store new learnings asynchronously
- **kuzu_recall**: Query specific memories
- **kuzu_stats**: Get memory system statistics

## Project Context

Browser console log capture and control via MCP for Claude Code

## Key Technologies
- Python

## Development Guidelines
- Use kuzu-memory enhance for all AI interactions
- Store important decisions with kuzu-memory learn
- Query context with kuzu-memory recall when needed
- Keep memories project-specific and relevant

## Memory Guidelines

- Store project decisions and conventions
- Record technical specifications and API details
- Capture user preferences and patterns
- Document error solutions and workarounds

## Project Organization

**Organization Standard**: [docs/reference/PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md](docs/reference/PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md)

### Quick Reference

**File Placement Rules:**
- All `.md` files (except README, CHANGELOG, CLAUDE) → `docs/`
- User guides → `docs/guides/`
- Release documentation → `docs/guides/releases/`
- Implementation docs → `docs/developer/`
- Test reports → `docs/testing/`
- Python tests → `tests/unit/` or `tests/integration/`
- HTML fixtures → `tests/fixtures/`
- Demo pages → `examples/`
- Scripts → `scripts/`

**Naming Conventions:**
- Python: `snake_case.py` (PEP 8)
- Docs in root: `UPPERCASE.md`
- Docs in subdirs: `Title_Case.md`
- Directories: `lowercase-with-hyphens`

**Before Adding Files:**
1. Check PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md for proper location
2. Use `git mv` when moving tracked files
3. Update imports and references
4. Run `make test` to verify

See [PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md](docs/reference/PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md) for complete standards.
