# pytest-intent

A pytest plugin for intent-based testing that tracks requirement coverage and ensures all requirements have passing tests.

## Description

pytest-intent is a pytest plugin that enables intent-based testing by tracking requirement coverage. It integrates with [Doorstop](https://github.com/jacebrowning/doorstop) to load project requirements and validates that:

- All requirements have tests covering them
- All tests for requirements are passing

The plugin can be configured to fail, warn, or ignore when requirements are untested, and will fail if requirements have failing tests, helping ensure comprehensive test coverage aligned with your project's requirements.

## Features

- **Requirement Coverage Tracking**: Automatically tracks which requirements are covered by tests
- **Validation**: Fails test runs if requirements are missing tests or have failing tests
- **Doorstop Integration**: Seamlessly loads requirements from Doorstop-formatted directories
- **Reference Autofill**: Automatically populates Doorstop requirements' `references` field with test nodeids
- **Flexible Configuration**: Configurable requirements path and format
- **pytest Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing pytest workflows

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13
- pytest 9.0 or later

### Using Poetry (Recommended)

```bash
# (we suggest ensuring it is part of a dev/development group)
poetry add --group=dev pytest-intent

# otherwise
poetry add pytest-intent
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install pytest-intent
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Mark your tests with the `@pytest.mark.intent` decorator to associate them with requirements:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.intent(requirement="SRD-001")
def test_feature_implementation():
    """Test that verifies SRD-001 requirement."""
    assert feature_works_correctly()

# Alternative syntax
@pytest.mark.intent("SRD-002")
def test_another_feature():
    """Test that verifies SRD-002 requirement."""
    assert another_feature_works()
```

### Running Tests

Run your tests as usual with pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

The plugin will automatically:
1. Load requirements from your requirements directory (default: `requirements/`)
2. Track which requirements are covered by tests
3. Validate that all requirements have tests
4. Validate that all requirement tests are passing

By default, if any requirements are untested or have failing tests, the test run will fail with a detailed error message. The behavior for untested requirements can be configured using `--intent-requirements-untested-behavior`.

### Example Output

When all requirements are covered and passing:

```
============================= test session starts ==============================
collected 2 items

tests/test_example.py::test_feature_implementation PASSED
tests/test_example.py::test_another_feature PASSED

============================== 2 passed in 0.01s ===============================
```

If requirements are untested or failing:

```
============================= test session starts ==============================
collected 2 items

tests/test_example.py::test_feature_implementation PASSED
tests/test_example.py::test_another_feature FAILED

Requirement coverage validation failed:
  - Untested requirements (1): SRD-003
  - Requirements with failing tests (1): SRD-002 (failing tests: tests/test_example.py::test_another_feature)

============================== 1 failed, 1 passed in 0.01s ===============================
```

## Configuration

### Command-Line Options

The plugin provides several command-line options for configuration:

#### `--intent-enabled`

Enable or disable the intent plugin. The plugin is enabled by default.

```bash
# Enable explicitly (default)
pytest --intent-enabled
pytest --intent-enabled=true

# Disable the plugin
pytest --intent-enabled=false
```

#### `--intent-requirements-format`

Specify the format of your requirements. Currently only `doorstop` is supported (default).

```bash
pytest --intent-requirements-format=doorstop
```

#### `--intent-requirements-path`

Specify the path to the directory containing your requirements. Defaults to `requirements`.

```bash
pytest --intent-requirements-path=./my_requirements
pytest --intent-requirements-path=/absolute/path/to/requirements
```

#### `--intent-references-autofill-enabled`

Enable or disable automatic filling of Doorstop requirements' `references` field with test nodeids. When enabled, the plugin automatically updates the `references` field in Doorstop requirement files with the test nodeids of tests that cover each requirement. Defaults to `false`.

```bash
# Enable autofill
pytest --intent-references-autofill-enabled
pytest --intent-references-autofill-enabled=true

# Disable autofill (default)
pytest --intent-references-autofill-enabled=false
```

#### `--intent-references-outdated-behavior`

Control the behavior when Doorstop requirements' `references` field is outdated (doesn't match the current test coverage). Defaults to `ignore`.

Options:
- `ignore`: Do nothing (default)
- `warn`: Log a warning message but continue
- `fail`: Fail the test run early before tests execute

```bash
# Fail if references are outdated
pytest --intent-references-outdated-behavior=fail

# Warn if references are outdated
pytest --intent-references-outdated-behavior=warn

# Ignore outdated references (default)
pytest --intent-references-outdated-behavior=ignore
```

#### `--intent-requirements-untested-behavior`

Control the behavior when requirements are untested (have no tests covering them). Defaults to `fail`.

Options:
- `fail`: Fail the test run (default)
- `warn`: Log a warning message but continue
- `ignore`: Do nothing

```bash
# Fail if requirements are untested (default)
pytest --intent-requirements-untested-behavior=fail

# Warn if requirements are untested
pytest --intent-requirements-untested-behavior=warn

# Ignore untested requirements
pytest --intent-requirements-untested-behavior=ignore
```

### Complete Example

```bash
pytest \
    --intent-enabled \
    --intent-requirements-format=doorstop \
    --intent-requirements-path=requirements
```

## Reference Autofill

pytest-intent can automatically populate the `references` field in Doorstop requirement files with the test nodeids of tests that cover each requirement. This helps maintain traceability between requirements and their test cases.

### How It Works

When autofill is enabled, the plugin:
1. Collects all tests marked with `@pytest.mark.intent` during test collection
2. Groups tests by their associated requirement ID
3. Updates each requirement's `references` field with the sorted list of test nodeids
4. Saves the updated requirement files

The test nodeids are stored in alphabetical order for deterministic, consistent results.

### Enabling Autofill

To enable automatic reference filling:

```bash
pytest --intent-references-autofill-enabled
```

When autofill is enabled, the plugin will automatically update the `references` field in your Doorstop requirement files before tests run.

### Example

Given a requirement file `requirements/SRD-001.yml`:

```yaml
active: true
derived: false
header: ''
level: 1.0
links: []
normative: true
ref: ''
reviewed: null
text: 'The plugin should be able to register with pytest.'
```

And tests marked with `@pytest.mark.intent(requirement="SRD-001")`:

```python
@pytest.mark.intent(requirement="SRD-001")
def test_plugin_is_registered():
    ...

@pytest.mark.intent(requirement="SRD-001")
def test_plugin_configuration():
    ...
```

After running with autofill enabled, the requirement file will be updated:

```yaml
active: true
derived: false
header: ''
level: 1.0
links: []
normative: true
ref: ''
references:
  - path: tests/test_plugin.py::test_plugin_configuration
    type: file
  - path: tests/test_plugin.py::test_plugin_is_registered
    type: file
reviewed: null
text: 'The plugin should be able to register with pytest.'
```

### Outdated References Detection

The plugin can detect when requirement `references` fields are outdated (don't match the current test coverage). You can control the behavior with `--intent-references-outdated-behavior`:

- **`ignore`** (default): Do nothing, silently continue
- **`warn`**: Log a warning message but continue with the test run
- **`fail`**: Fail the test run immediately before any tests execute

This is useful in CI/CD pipelines to ensure that requirement files are kept up-to-date:

```bash
# Fail the build if references are outdated
pytest --intent-references-outdated-behavior=fail
```

### Best Practices

1. **Enable autofill in development**: Use `--intent-references-autofill-enabled` during development to automatically keep references up-to-date
2. **Use `fail` in CI/CD**: Set `--intent-references-outdated-behavior=fail` in your CI/CD pipeline to catch outdated references before they're committed
3. **Commit updated files**: When autofill updates references, commit the changes to version control to maintain traceability

### Complete Autofill Example

```bash
# Enable autofill and fail if references are outdated
pytest \
    --intent-enabled \
    --intent-references-autofill-enabled \
    --intent-references-outdated-behavior=fail \
    --intent-requirements-path=requirements
```

## Requirements Format

pytest-intent currently supports loading requirements from [Doorstop](https://github.com/jacebrowning/doorstop) format. Doorstop stores requirements as YAML files in a directory structure.

### Doorstop Requirements

Each requirement is stored as a YAML file (e.g., `SRD-001.yml`) in your requirements directory. The plugin automatically loads all requirement IDs from the Doorstop document.

Example requirement file (`requirements/SRD-001.yml`):

```yaml
active: true
derived: false
header: ''
level: 1.0
links: []
normative: true
ref: ''
reviewed: null
text: 'The plugin should be able to register with pytest.'
```

The requirement ID (e.g., `SRD-001`) is derived from the filename and must match the requirement ID used in your test markers.

### References Field

When using the autofill feature, the `references` field will be automatically populated with test nodeids. Each reference entry contains:
- `path`: The test nodeid (e.g., `tests/test_file.py::test_function`)
- `type`: The reference type (always `file` for test references)

Example requirement file with references (`requirements/SRD-001.yml`):

```yaml
active: true
derived: false
header: ''
level: 1.0
links: []
normative: true
ref: ''
references:
  - path: tests/test_plugin.py::test_plugin_configuration
    type: file
  - path: tests/test_plugin.py::test_plugin_is_registered
    type: file
reviewed: null
text: 'The plugin should be able to register with pytest.'
```

The `references` field is optional and will be automatically updated when autofill is enabled.

### Excluding Requirements from Coverage

You can exclude specific requirements from test coverage tracking by adding a custom attribute to the requirement's YAML file. This is useful for:

- **Deprecated requirements**: Requirements that are no longer relevant but kept for historical reference
- **Future requirements**: Requirements that are planned but not yet implemented
- **Documentation-only requirements**: Requirements that describe documentation or process rather than code functionality

To exclude a requirement, add the `intent.requirements.devstrek.com/exclude: true` attribute to the requirement's YAML file:

Example requirement file with exclusion (`requirements/SRD-005.yml`):

```yaml
active: true
derived: false
header: ''
level: 1.4
links: []
normative: true
ref: ''
reviewed: null
intent.requirements.devstrek.com/exclude: true
text: 'The system should be able to exclude requirements from coverage tracking.'
```

Excluded requirements:
- Are **not loaded** into the coverage tracking system
- Will **not appear** in untested requirements validation
- Will **not appear** in failing requirements validation
- Are **completely ignored** by the plugin

If you want to include a requirement that was previously excluded, simply:
- Remove the `intent.requirements.devstrek.com/exclude` attribute, or
- Set it to `false`: `intent.requirements.devstrek.com/exclude: false`

## Development

### Setting Up Development Environment

#### Using Dev Container (Recommended)

The recommended way to set up the development environment is using a dev container with your IDE (VS Code, Cursor, etc.). This ensures a consistent development environment with all dependencies pre-configured.

1. Open the repository in your IDE
2. When prompted, select "Reopen in Container" or use the command palette to run "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
3. The dev container will automatically set up the environment with all dependencies

#### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up the environment manually:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/devstrek/pytest-intent.git
cd pytest-intent
```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
```bash
poetry install --with=dev
```

3. Install the package in editable mode:
```bash
poe install
```
