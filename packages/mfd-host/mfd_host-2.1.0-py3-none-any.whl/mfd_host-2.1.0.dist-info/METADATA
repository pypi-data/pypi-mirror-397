# MFD Host

MFD Host provides a unified Python interface for managing and interacting with Systems Under Tests (SUTs) AKA Hosts and their capabilities across multiple operating systems.
It consists of multiple features like `network`, `driver`, `cpu`, `memory`, etc.

class Host{
    +str: name
    +Connection: connection
    +List[NetworkInterface]: network_interfaces
    +CliClient: cli_client
    +Connections: connections
    +PowerManagement: power_mng
    +TopologyModel: topology
    --- Features ---
    +NetworkAdapterOwner: network
    +PackageManager: driver
    +refresh_network_interfaces()
}

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ESXi Users ONLY\
> This module requires `vsphere-automation-sdk` to work.\
> Please add `vsphere-automation-sdk` to your requirements file or install it manually:
> ```bash
> pip install vsphere-automation-sdk @ git+https://github.com/vmware/vsphere-automation-sdk-python@v8.0.3.0
> ```
> For currently supported version of `vsphere-automation-sdk` please refer to [mfd-esxi/README](https://github.com/intel/mfd-esxi).

## Usage

### How to instantiate Host? 

```python
from mfd_connect.util.connection_utils import Connections
from pytest_mfd_config.fixtures import create_host_connections_from_model, create_power_mng_from_model

_connections = create_host_connections_from_model(host_model)
connections = Connections(_connections)

power_mng = create_power_mng_from_model(host_model.power_mng) if host_model.power_mng else None
host = Host(
    connection=_connections[0],
    name=host_model.name,
    cli_client=cli_client,
    connections=connections,
    power_mng=power_mng,
    topology=host_model,
)
```
### How to use host object? 

```python
from mfd_typing.network_interface import InterfaceType
(...)
host.refresh_network_interfaces()  # to refresh host interfaces
(...)
host.refresh_network_interfaces(ignore_instantiate=True)  # to refresh all interfaces (including ones with 'instantiate' set to False)
(...)
host.network.vlan.create_vlan(vlan_id=100, interface_name="foo", vlan_name="foo_100") # to create VLAN interface
host.refresh_network_interfaces(extended=[InterfaceType.VLAN])  # to append foo_100 interface to list of network_interfaces
```

### Host Methods (API):

- `refresh_network_interfaces(ignore_instantiate: bool = False, extend: List[InterfaceType]] = None) -> None` : Update list of `NetworkInterface` objects stored in `self.network_interfaces` attribute. Method's behavior varies based on used flags or passed topology data:

>:information_source: Once interfaces are added to the list they will be always updated, not being recreated, e.g. `id(interface_1)` shall point to same address in memory before and after method call.

Logic in details, there are 2 main cases we should consider:
1) host model containing network interfaces passed as an argument to Host constructor
    * a) ignore_instantiate == False (default): Interfaces that have flag 'instantiate' set in topology will be refreshed
    * b) ignore_instantiate == True: All interfaces mentioned in topology model (regardless of 'instantiate' flag value) will be refreshed
    * c) extended param in use: List of InterfaceType objects that should be also refreshed
2) host model without network interfaces passed to Host constructor
 
>For case 1c) if user expect new interfaces to appear, e.g. VFs, then they should call the method with following params:
`host.refresh_network_interfaces(extended=[InterfaceType.VF])`
so that will return list of topology interfaces + all VFs captured on the system

For more examples please check [interface_refresh_examples.py](/examples/interface_refresh_examples.py)

## Available features

### - Network

It's a pass-through to the `mfd-network-adapter`'s owner object, which let you use its methods and features by `network` attribute.

[Available API](https://github.com/intel/mfd-network-adapter)

Example:
```python
host.network.get_interfaces(all_interfaces=True)
host.network.vxlan.delete_vxlan(vxlan_name="vxlan")
host.network.vlan.remove_all_vlans()
```

### - Driver

It's a pass-through to the `mfd-package-manager`'s object, which let you use its methods and features by `driver` attribute.

[Available API](https://github.com/intel/mfd-package-manager)

Example:
```python
host.driver.uninstall_module(module_name="module_name")
```

### - Event
For FreeBSD, Linux and ESXi hosts it's a pass-through to the `mfd-dmesg`'s object.

For Windows host it's a pass-through to the `mfd-event-log`'s object. 
> [!CAUTION]
> Event feature for Windows supports only RPyCConnection

Methods and features are accessible by `event` attribute.

### - Virtualization

It's a pass-through to the one of [`HypervHypervisor` (`mfd-hyperv`), `KVMHypervisor` (`mfd-kvm`), `ESXiHypervisor` (`mfd-esxi`)] objects, which let you use its methods and features by `virtualization` attribute.

Auto-selection is based on OS:
```python
os_name_to_class = {
    OSName.LINUX: KVMHypervisor,
    OSName.FREEBSD: KVMHypervisor,
    OSName.WINDOWS: HypervHypervisor,
    OSName.ESXI: ESXiHypervisor,
