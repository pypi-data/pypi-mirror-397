## Git Commit Guidelines

1.  **Subject Line**: Provide a concise summary (50-70 characters) of the change.
2.  **Body (Optional)**: Include details on *why* the change was made, important decisions, and edge cases.
3.  **Voice**: Use active and imperative voice (e.g., "Fix bug," "Add feature").
4.  **Atomicity**: Each commit should be atomic, focusing on a single logical change (e.g., do not mix refactors, fixes, and features).
5.  **Language**: Always write commit messages in English.

## Pull Request Structure

1.  **Overview**: Provide a high-level summary of the changes, avoiding repetition of individual commit messages.
2.  **Content**: Include what was done, why it was done, and its impact on other modules.
3.  **Size**: Keep PRs small and focused; avoid "mega PRs."
4.  **Language**: Always write pull request descriptions in English.
