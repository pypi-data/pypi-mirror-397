# ARP Standard Python SDK

Python client and model layer aligned with `spec/v1alpha2`.

- PyPI distribution: `arp-standard-py`
- Import package: `arp_sdk`

## Install from source (editable)

```bash
python -m pip install -r tools/codegen/python/requirements.txt
python tools/codegen/python/generate.py --version v1alpha2
python -m pip install -e sdks/python
```

## Usage

```python
from arp_sdk.clients import ToolRegistryClient
from arp_sdk.tool_registry.api.default.get_v1alpha2_tools import sync as list_tools

client = ToolRegistryClient(base_url="http://localhost:8081")
tools = list_tools(client=client)
```

## Build artifact locally

```bash
python -m pip install -r tools/codegen/python/requirements-dev.txt
python tools/codegen/python/build_local.py --version v1alpha2 --clean
```

## Release (PyPI)

The GitHub Actions workflow `release` publishes this package when you push a tag matching:

- `v<version>` (example: `v1.0.0a2`)

The workflow verifies the tag matches `sdks/python/pyproject.toml` and `arp_sdk.__version__`, then builds and publishes using PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC).
It also rejects tags that are not contained in `origin/main`.

On tag pushes, the workflow also creates a GitHub Release and uploads the wheel/sdist as release assets.
