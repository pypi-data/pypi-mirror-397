## ✨ Features

### 🗣️ Interactive AI Chat
- Natural conversations about your code
- Context-aware AI with full repository understanding
- Code generation with permission workflow
- Multi-provider support (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Grok, TogetherAI)

### 📊 Diagram-First Workflow

- Iterative refinement with user approval
- Tech stack capture for future sessions

### 🔧 Agentic Code Modification
- AI proposes changes, you approve
- File/folder creation with explicit permission
- Command execution with user confirmation
- Quality-focused task chunking

### 🧠 Persistent Memory
- AI remembers what it learns about your codebase
- Cross-session knowledge retention
- Automatic learning from approved changes
- Storage at `~/.stacksense/{workspace}/{repo}/`

### 📊 Dependency Diagrams
- Automatic dependency graph generation
- Multi-language support (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust)
- Export to JSON, DOT, and Mermaid formats

### 🔍 Intelligent Repository Scanning
- Smart file discovery with gitignore support
- Language detection and framework identification
- Incremental scanning with caching

### 🌐 Web Search Integration
- Deep search: AI fetches and reads actual page content
- Prioritizes StackOverflow, GitHub, Reddit, Medium, Dev.to
- Rate limited to prevent abuse

### 🔄 Dynamic Model Switching
- Switch between 100+ models on-the-fly

## 🚀 Installation

### Basic Install (Python 3.9+)

```bash
pipx install stacksense-cli
# Or with pip:
pip install stacksense-cli
```

✅ All 40+ AI tools work with regex-based code parsing

### Full Install (Python 3.9-3.12) 

```bash
pipx install "stacksense-cli[full]"
# Or with pip:
pip install "stacksense-cli[full]"
```

✅ Enhanced syntax parsing with tree-sitter for more accurate diagrams

> **Note**: Tree-sitter support requires Python <3.13. On Python 3.13+, StackSense automatically falls back to regex parsing.

### Development Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmariahAK/Stacksense.git
cd stacksense
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** (3.9-3.12 for full tree-sitter support)
- **API Key** from your chosen provider

### API Key Setup

StackSense v1.0 supports **OpenRouter** only. More providers coming soon!

> **⚠️ Note on AI Model Reliability**  
> AI models (both free and paid) may occasionally hallucinate, lose context, or fail to call tools correctly—especially older models. We've optimized StackSense to minimize these issues and provide a seamless experience, but occasional quirks may occur. For best results, use newer models like GPT-5, Claude 4.5, Gemini 3, or Grok 4.

```bash
# OpenRouter (available in v1.0 - access to 100+ models)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-your-key-here"

# Coming in v2.0:
# OLLAMA - Local models (no API key needed)

# Coming in v3.0:
# OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
# GROK_API_KEY="xai-your-key-here"
# TOGETHER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

## 🤖 Supported AI Providers

| Provider | Description | Status | Version |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------|
| **OpenRouter** | Multi-provider gateway | ✅ Available | v1.0 |
| Ollama | Local models | 🔜 Coming | v2.0 |
| OpenAI | GPT-4, GPT-4o | 🔜 Coming | v3.0 |
