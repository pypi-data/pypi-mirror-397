# MITRE ATT&CK and MBC for Django

This package utilizes MITRE's open data to incorporate their knowledge base into a Django project. The indented goal of this project is to provide the data as Django Models for integration into project's using MITRE references. The display of that information is secondary and only available because it is advantageous to be able to visualize the data in a familiar way.

This project syncs with the open data provided by MITRE in a git repository. We consume that data into database records and slightly modify the data for better visual representation.


## Installation in a Django project

Please refer to the [installation docs](docs/install.md) for details.

### Using the Example Project

There is an `example` directory located in this repository that contains an example Django project with the app loaded within it. See [usage docs](docs/example.md) for details.
