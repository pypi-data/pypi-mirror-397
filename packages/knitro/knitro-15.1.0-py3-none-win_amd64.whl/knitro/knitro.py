'''Usage of Knitro Python Single call function is described here.

Alternatively to the Python interface of the Knitro callable
library functions, the user has the possibility to directly pass
an optimization problem structure to Knitro and solve it in a
single call fashion using the :meth:`optimize` method.

The definition of the problem structure is allowed using dedicated
Knitro structures: :class:`.Variables`, :class:`.Objective`,
:class:`.Constraints`, :class:`.ComplementarityConstraints` and
:class:`.Callback`.

class Variables:
    '''Store mathematical definition of the variables.

    nV: int
        Number of variables.

    xTypes: array, optional
        The type of the variables (e.g. :envvar:`KN_VARTYPE_CONTINUOUS`,
        :envvar:`KN_VARTYPE_BINARY`, :envvar:`KN_VARTYPE_INTEGER`).
        There are two ways to specify the types:

        1. array, shape (nV, 1): define all the variables type.

        2. array, shape (2, n_vars): define the type for a subset of `n_vars`
        variables using two arrays. The first array defines
        the variables index and the second one their types. For example,
        variables 0 and 2 are defined as binary::

            xTypes=[[0, 2], [KN_VARTYPE_BINARY, KN_VARTYPE_BINARY]]

        If not set, variables are assumed to be continuous by default.

    xLoBnds: array, optional
        The lower bounds of the variables. There are two
        ways to specify the lower bounds:

        1. array, shape (nV, 1): define all the variables lower bound.

        2. array, shape (2, n_vars): define the lower bound for `n_vars`
        variables using two arrays. The first
        array defines the variables index and the second one their
        lower bounds. For examples, variables 0 and 2 have their lower bounds
        set to 0::

            xLoBnds=[[0, 2], [0, 0]]

        If not set, lower bounds are assumed to be :envvar:`-KN_INFINITY`.

    xUpBnds: array, optional
        The upper bounds of the variables. There are two
        ways to specify the upper bounds:

        1. array, shape (nV, 1): define all the variables upper bound.

        2. array, shape (2, n_vars): define the upper bound for `n_vars`
        variables using two arrays. The first
        array defines the variables index and the second one their
        upper bounds. For example, variables 0 and 2 have their upper bounds
        set to 10::

            xUpBnds=[[0, 2], [10, 10]]

        If not set, upper bounds are assumed to be :envvar:`KN_INFINITY`.

    xInitVals: array, optional
        The initial primal values of the variables. There are two
        ways to specify the initial values:

        1. array, shape (nV, 1): define all the variables initial values.

        2. array, shape (2, n_vars): define the initial values for `n_vars`
        variables using two arrays. The first
        array defines the variables index and the second one their
        values. For example, variables 0 and 2 are initially set to -1 and 3::

            xInitVals=[[0, 2], [-1, 3]]

        If not set, variables may be initialized as 0 or initialized
        by Knitro based on some initialization strategy
        (perhaps determined by a user option).

    lambdaInitVals: array, optional
        The initial dual values of the variables (i.e. the Lagrange
        multipliers corresponding to the bounded variables).
        There are two ways to specify the initial dual values:

        1. array, shape (nV, 1): defines all the variables initial values.

        2. array, shape (2, n_vars): defines the initial values for `n_vars`
        variables only using two arrays. The first
        array defines the variables index and the second one their
        values. For example, variables 0 and 2 are initially set to -1 and 3::

            lambdaInitVals=[[0, 2], [-1, 3]]

        If not set, dual variables may be initialized as 0 or initialized
        by Knitro based on some initialization strategy
        (perhaps determined by a user option).

    xScale: array, optional
        Define scaling of variables to perform a linear
        scaling around specified centering values::

            x[i] = xScaleFactors[i] * xScaled[i] + xScaleCenters[i]

        These scaling factors should try to represent the `typical`
        values of the `x` variables so that the scaled variables
        (`xScaled`) used internally by Knitro are close to one. The values
        for xScaleFactors should be positive. If a non-positive
        value is specified, that variable will not be scaled.
        There are two ways to specify the scaling value:

        1. array, shape (2, nV): define all the variables xScaleFactors and
        xScaleCenters as two arrays.

        2. array, shape (3, n_vars): define the scaling values for `n_vars`
        variables only using three arrays. The first
        array defines the variables index, the second one their scaling
        factor and the third one their scaling center. For example,
        variables 0 and 2 only are scaled::

            xScale=[[0, 2], [2, 2], [0, 0]]

    xHonorBnds: array, optional
        Indicates whether to enforce satisfaction of simple
        variable bounds throughout the optimization (e.g
        :envvar:`KN_HONORBNDS_NO`, :envvar:`KN_HONORBNDS_ALWAYS`,
        :envvar:`KN_HONORBNDS_INITPT`). There are two ways to specify
        the honor bounds values:

        1. array, shape (nV, 1): defines all the variables honor bounds.

        2. array, shape (2, n_vars): defines the honor bounds for `n_vars`
        variables only using two arrays. The first
        array defines the variables index and the second one their
        values. For example, we enforce that variables 0 and 2 satisfy their
        bounds at initial point::

            xHonorBnds=[[0, 2], [KN_HONORBNDS_INITPT, KN_HONORBNDS_INITPT]]

    xProperties: array, optional
        Specify some properties of the variables. Currently this routine
        is only used to mark variables as linear (e.g :envvar:`KN_VAR_LINEAR`).
        There are two ways to specify the properties:

        1. array, shape (nV, 1): define all the variables properties.

        2. array, shape (2, n_vars): define the properties for `n_vars`
        variables using two arrays. The first
        array defines the variables index and the second one their
        properties. For example, we mark variables 0 and 2 as linear::

            xProperties=[[0, 2], [KN_VAR_LINEAR, KN_VAR_LINEAR]]

        Variables are assumed to be nonlinear variables by default.

    xNames: array, optional
        Specify the name of the variables so that Knitro can internally
        print out these names. There are two ways to specify the
        names of the variables:

        1. array, shape (nV, 1): define all the variables names.

        2. array, shape (2, n_vars): define the names for `n_vars`
        variables using two arrays. The first
        array defines the variables index and the second one their
        names. For example, we name variables 0 and 2::

            xNames=[[0, 2], ['var0', 'var2']]).

class Constraints:
    '''Store mathematical definition of the contraints.

    nC: int
        The number of constraints

    cType: array, optional
        The type of the constraints (e.g. :envvar:`KN_CONTYPE_GENERAL`,
        :envvar:`KN_CONTYPE_LINEAR`, :envvar:`KN_CONTYPE_QUADRATIC).`
        There are two ways to specify the types:

        1. array, shape (nC, 1): define all the constraints types.

        2. array, shape (2, n_cons): define the types for `n_cons`
        constraints using two arrays. The first array defines
        the constraints index and the second one their types.
        For example, constraints 0 and 2 are defined as linear::

            cType=[[0, 2], [KN_CONTYPE_LINEAR, KN_CONTYPE_LINEAR]]

        If not set, constraints are assumed to be general.

    cLoBnds: array, optional
        The lower bounds of the constraints. There are two
        ways to specify the lower bounds:

        1. array, shape (nC, 1): define all the constraints lower bounds.

        2. array, shape (2, n_cons): define the lower bounds for `n_cons`
        constraints using two arrays. The first
        array defines the constraints index and the second one their
        lower bounds. For example, constraints 0 and 2 have their
        lower bounds set to 0::

            cLoBnds=[[0, 2], [0, 0]]

        If not set, lower bounds are assumed to be :envvar:`-KN_INFINITY`.

    cUpBnds: array, optional
        The upper bounds of the constraints. There are two
        ways to specify the upper bounds:

        1. array, shape (nC, 1): define all the constraints upper bounds.

        2. array, shape (2, n_cons): define the upper bound for `n_cons`
        constraints using two arrays. The first
        array defines the constraints index and the second one their
        upper bounds. For example, constraints 0 and 2 have their upper
        bounds set to 10::

            cUpBnds=[[0, 2], [10, 10]]

        If not set, upper bounds are assumed to be :envvar:`KN_INFINITY`.

    cEqBnds: array, optional
        The equality bounds of the constraints. There are two
        ways to specify the equality bounds:

        1. array, shape (nC, 1): define all the constraints equality bounds.

        2. array, shape (2, n_cons): define the equality bound for `n_cons`
        constraints using two arrays. The first
        array defines the constraints index and the second one their
        equality bounds. For example, constraints 0 and 2 have their
        equality bounds set to 10::

            cEqBnds=[[0, 2], [10, 10]]

    cConstant: array, optional
        Add constants to the body of constraint functions. There are two
        ways to specify the constants:

        1. array, shape (nC, 1): define all the constraints constants.

        2. array, shape (2, n_cons): define the constant structure for `n_cons`
        constraints using two arrays. The first
        array defines the constraints index and the second one their
        values. For example, constraints 0 and 2 have a constant term equal to
        respectively -1 and 3::

            cConstant=[[0, 2], [-1, 3]]

    cLinear: array, optional
        Add linear structure to the constraints. There are two
        ways to specify the linear structure:

        1. array, shape (nC, 1): define all the constraints linear structure.

        2. array, shape (3, n_cons): define the linear structure for `n_cons`
        constraints using three arrays. The first
        array defines the constraint index, the second one the variable
        index and the third one the coefficient values. For example, constraints
        1 and 2 have one linear structure respectively equal to 2*x[0]
        and -x[3]::

            cLinear=[[1, 2], [0, 3], [2, -1]]

    cQuadratic: array, optional
        Add quadratic structure to the constraint functions. There are two
        ways to specify the quadratic structure:

        1. array, shape (nC, 1): define all the constraints quadratic structure.

        2. array, shape (4, n_cons): define the quadratic structure for `n_cons`
        constraints using four arrays. The first
        array defines the constraint index, the second one the first
        variable index, the third one the second variable index and
        the last one the coefficient values. For example, constraint 1
        has one quadratic structure equal to 2*x[0]*x[1]::

            cQuadratic=[[1], [0], [1], [2]]

    lambdaInitVals: array, optional
        The initial dual values of the constraints (i.e. the Lagrange
        multipliers for the constraints). There are two ways to specify
        the initial dual values:

        1. array, shape (nC, 1): define all the constraints initial values.

        2. array, shape (2, n_cons): define the initial values for `n_cons`
        constraints using two arrays. The first
        array defines the constraints index and the second one their
        values. For example, constraints 0 and 2 are initially set
        to -1 and 3::

            lambdaInitVals=[[0, 2], [-1, 3]]

        If not set, constraints dual variables may be initialized as 0
        or initialized by Knitro based on some initialization strategy
        (perhaps determined by a user option).

    cScaleFactors: array, optional
        Set an array of constraint scaling values to perform a scaling::

            cScaled[i] = cScaleFactors[i] * c[i]

        for each constraint. These scaling factors should try to
        represent the `typical` values of the inverse of the constraint
        values `c` so that the scaled constraints (`cScaled`) used
        internally by Knitro are close to one. The values
        for cScaleFactors should be positive. If a non-positive value
        is specified, that constraint will use either the standard Knitro
        scaling (:envvar:`KN_SCALE_USER_INTERNAL`), or no scaling
        (:envvar:`KN_SCALE_USER_NONE`).
        Scaling factors for standard constraints can be provided with
        `cScaleFactors`, while scalings for complementarity constraint can
        be specified with `ccScaleFactors` (see Complementarity constraints).
        There are two ways to specify the scaling value:

        1. array, shape (nC, 1): define all the constraints cScaleFactors.

        2. array, shape (2, n_cons): define the scaling values for `n_cons`
        constraints using two arrays. The first
        array defines the constraints index and the second one their scaling
        factor (e.g constraints 0 and 2 only are scaled)::

            cScaleFactors=[[0, 2], [2, 2]

    cNames: array, optional
        Specify the names of the constraints so that Knitro can internally
        print out them. There are two ways to specify the
        constraints names:

        1. array, shape (nC, 1): define all the constraints names.

        2. array, shape (2, n_cons): define the names for `n_cons`
        constraints using two arrays. The first
        array defines the constraints index and the second one their
        names. For example, we name constraints 0 and 2::

            cNames=[[0, 2], ['con0', 'con2']]

        (:envvar:`KN_SCALE_USER_NONE`). There are two ways to specify
        the scaling value:

        1. array, shape (nCc, 1): define all the constraints ccScaleFactors.

        2. array, shape (2, n_cons): define the scaling values for `n_cons`
        complementarity constraints using two arrays. The first
        array defines the constraints index and the second one their
        scaling factor. For example, complementarity constraints 0
        and 2 only are scaled::

            ccScaleFactors=[[0, 2], [2, 2]]

    cNames: array, optional
        Specify the name of the complementarity constraints so that
        Knitro can internally print out these names. There are two
        ways to specify the complementarity constraints names:

        1. array, shape (nCc, 1): define all the constraints names.

        2. array, shape (2, n_cons): define the names for `n_cons`
        complementarity constraints only using two arrays. The first
        array defines the constraints index and the second one their
        names. For example, we name complementarity constraints 0 and 2::

class Callback:
    '''Store the definition of optimization callbacks.

    funcCallback: Function
        Function evaluating the objective and any constraint
        parts involved in this callback. If `evalFCGA` is equal to `True`,
        the callback should also evaluate the relevant first
        derivatives/gradients.

    evalObj: boolean, optional
        Indicate whether any part of the objective function is evaluated
        in the callback. If not specified, `evalObj` is set to `False`.
        If both, `evalObj` and `indexCons` are not specified, the
        funcCallback is considered to provide a generic callback
        evaluating the objective function and all constraints.

    indexCons: array of shape (n_cons,), optional
        Index of the `n_cons` constraints evaluated in the callback.
        If not specified, indexCons is set to `None`. If both `evalObj` and
        `indexCons` are not specified, the funcCallback is considered
        to provide a callback for objective function and all constraints.

    evalFCGA: boolean, optional
        Indicate if the first derivatives/gradients are also
        evaluated in the funcCallBack.

        Note: It is generally more efficient and recommended
        to have separate callback routines for functions and
        gradients since a gradient evaluation is not always
        needed for every function evaluations. However, in some
        cases, it may be more convenient to compute them together
        if most of the work for computing the gradients is already
        done while evaluating the function.

    gradCallback: Function, optional
        Function evaluating the components of the first derivatives/gradients
        of the objective and the constraint involved in this callback.
        If not specified, Knitro will approximate
        the gradient using finite-differencing. However, we recommend
        providing callbacks to evaluate the exact gradients whenever
        possible as this can drastically improve the performance of Knitro.
        If `evalFCGA` is `True`, the first derivatives are expected to be
        evaluated in the funcCallback and gradCallback is not required.

    objGradIndexVars: array of shape (n_vars,), optionnal
        The `n_vars` nonzero indices of the objective gradient. If the
        objective gradient evaluated in gradCallback is dense,
        `objGradIndexVars` should be set to :envvar:`KN_DENSE`.

    jacIndexCons: array of shape (nnzj,), optional
        Store `nnzj` indexes (row) of each nonzero in the Jacobian of
        the constraints involved in this callback. If the Jacobian
        evaluated in gradCallback is dense, jacIndexCons should be set
        to :envvar:`KN_DENSE_ROWMAJOR` to provide the full Jacobian in
        row major order (i.e. ordered by rows/constraints), or
        :envvar:`KN_DENSE_COLMAJOR` to provide the full Jacobian
        in column major order (i.e. ordered by columns/variables).
        The user should always try to define the sparsity
        structure for the Jacobian (`jacIndexCons`, `jacIndexVars`).
        Even when using finite-difference approximations to compute
        the gradients, knowing the sparse structure of the Jacobian
        can allow Knitro to compute these finite-difference
        approximations faster.

    jacIndexVars: array of shape (nnzj,), optional
        Store `nnzj` index (column) of each nonzero in the Jacobian of
        the constraints parts involved in this callback. If the Jacobian
        evaluated in gradCallback is dense, jacIndexVars is not required.

    hessCallback: Function, optional
        Function evaluating the components of the Hessian of the Lagrangian
        corresponding to the objective and any constraint
        involved in this callback. If not specified, Knitro will
        approximate the Hessian by finite-difference.
        However, providing a callback for the
        exact Hessian (as well as the non-zero sparsity structure) can
        greatly improve Knitro performance and is recommended if possible.

    hessIndexVars1: array of shape (nnzh,), optional
        Store `nnzh` index of each nonzero in the Hessian of the
        Lagrangian. If the Hessian evaluated in hessCallback is dense,
        hessIndexVars1 should be set to :envvar:`KN_DENSE_ROWMAJOR`
        to provide the full upper triangular Hessian in row major
        order, or :envvar:`KN_DENSE_COLMAJOR` to provide the full
        upper triangular Hessian in column major order.
        Note that the Hessian is symmetric, so the lower
        triangular components are the same as the upper triangular
        components with row and column indices swapped.

    hessIndexVars2: array of shape (nnzh,), optional
        Store `nnzh` index of of each nonzero in the Hessian of the
        Lagrangian. If the Hessian evaluated in hessCallback is dense,
        hessIndexVars2 is not required.

    hessianNoFAllow: boolean, optional
        Specify that the user is able to provide evaluations of the
        Hessian matrix without the objective component. Turned off
        by default but should be enabled if possible.

    callbacks: array, Callback object, optional
        Structure containing all the :class:`knitro.Callback` related information.

    algorithm: int or str, optional
        The algorithms to be used by knitro:

        (1) `interior-direct`

        (2) `interior-cg`

        (3) `active-set`

        (4) `sqp`

        (6) `augmented-lagrangian`

    options: dict, optional
        A dictionary of solver options.

    optionsFile: str, optional
        A file containing solver options.

    Returns
    -------
