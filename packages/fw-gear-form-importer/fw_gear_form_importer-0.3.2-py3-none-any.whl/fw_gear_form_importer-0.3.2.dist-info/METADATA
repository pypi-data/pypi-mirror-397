### Outputs

#### Files

None

#### Metadata

The contents of the form responses, as key:value pairs.

### Pre-requisites

#### Prerequisite Gear Runs

None

#### Prerequisite Files

None

#### Prerequisite Metadata

Optional metadata for allow or deny form keys can be specified at the project level.

To modify which keys are imported, metadata can be added to the project level under a "context"
metadata object. You can specify keys to ALLOW, or keys to DENY, but not both. ALLOW keys take
precedent over DENY keys, meaning if both ALLOW and DENY keys are specified, only the ALLOW keys
will be ingested, and all DENY key rules will be ignored.

To add or remove keys on that list, specific key/value must be set on the project custom information
(`project.info`) like below:

```json
context:
   forms:
      json:
         <JSON-key>: True|False
```

`Key: value` should take the form of `Tag: bool`, where "True" means the key is ALLOWED, and "False"
means the key is DENIED.  In practice, all the keys should have the same value, as stated above, you
can only either allow or deny, not both at the same time.

To specify nested metadata keys, use standard dotty notation: `parent_key.child_key1`

By default, all form key/value pairs are imported to the file metadata, under the metadata key:
`file.info.forms.<file_type>`, (currently only 'json' is supported)

## Usage

### Description

Flywheel gear for importing metadata header of file to Flywheel. Metadata is stored under
`file.info.forms`.

#### File Specifications

Currently, supporting the following file types:

- json

##### *{Input-File}*

The input file should be a file containing form responses (question/answer as key:value pairs).

### Workflow

    classDef decide fill:#aaa,color:#fff
```

Description of workflow

1. An input file is provided
2. the parent project is examined for allow or deny keys in the specified metadata location
3. the file is parsed, allowing or denying keys depending on the project's metadata
4. the parsed keys are converted to a flywheel-compatible metadata dictionary
5. the metadata is uploaded to the input file under `file.info.forms.<file_type>`

### Use Cases

#### Use Case 1

__Conditions__:

- [x] A .json file containing form responses is ingested into flywheel
- [ ] Project.info.context.forms.json is empty
- [x] Project.info.context.forms.json has ALLOW keys
- [ ] Project.info.context.forms.json has DENY keys

a .json format file containing form responses is ingested into flywheel.  The researcher has
determined that they only want a subset of these responses indexed for searching in flywheel, so
they have specified those keys by adding them to `project.info.context.forms.json` as boolean
variables, and set their values to "True".

The gear will ingest the file, find the allow keys, and extract ONLY those keys to the file's
metadata.

### Logging

The log prints the name of the file being processed, and an output of the metadata created by the
process.
