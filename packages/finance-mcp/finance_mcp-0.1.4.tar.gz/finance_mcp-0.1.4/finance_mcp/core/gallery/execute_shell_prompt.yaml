tool_description: |
  A tool capable of executing shell commands can use `pwd` to check the current location, `cd` to navigate to a new directory, `ls` to view the contents of a directory, and execute scripts.
  Note that the starting directory is always the same each time the tool is invoked. If you need to perform multiple operations within a specific directory, you must include the full path in each command, for example: `cd aa/bb && bash xxx`.
