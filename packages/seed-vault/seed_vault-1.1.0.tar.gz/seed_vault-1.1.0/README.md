### Requirements

- 8 GB RAM
- Python >= 3.10, tested up to 3.14
- ObsPy (>=1.4.2), Streamlit (>=1.51), Plotly (>-5.24), Pandas (>=2.2.2), Matplotlib (>=3.8.5)

# Install via pip (easy way)

```
python3 -m pip install seed-vault
```

NB:

1. If you get an *"error: externally-managed-environment"* error, you will need to install and activate a new Python environment
   
    e.g.
    ```
    python3 -m venv ./venv
    . ./venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Assumes python & 'pip', 'venv' packages are installed

    e.g. for Ubuntu, as root:
    ```
    apt update
    apt install -y python3 python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv
    ```

# Install from source (if you insist!)

### Step 1: Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AuScope/seed-vault.git
```

### Step 2: Setup and run

Then can build via pip:

```
python3 -m pip install ./seed-vault
```

Or,

```
#### Linux/MacOS
cd seed-vault
source setup.sh
source run.sh
```

#### Windows

Open a powershell and run following commands:

```
cd seed-vault
.\setup-win.ps1
.\run-win.ps1
```

**NOTES:**

1. Requires get, sudo & python3 software packages

   e.g. for Ubuntu you may need install (as root):
   ```
   apt update
   apt install -y git sudo
   apt install -y python3 python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv
   ```

# Development

## Setting up with Poetry

If you look to further develop this app, it is highly recommended to set up the project with `poetry`. Follow the steps below to set up using `poetry`.

### Install poetry

Refer to this link: https://python-poetry.org/docs/

Alternatively,

**Linux**

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

then, add following to .bashrc:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

**Windows**
powershell:

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```

then, add poetry to your system path. It should be located here:

```
%USERPROFILE%\.poetry\bin
```

**Optional**
To configure poetry to create `.venv` inside project folder, run following:

```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

## Install pyenv (Optional)

This project uses python 3.10.\*. If your base python is a different version (check via `python --version`), you may get errors when trying to install via poetry. Use pyenv to manage this.

**Linux**

Install the required packages for building Python with the following command

```
sudo apt update

sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev
libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git
```

Then, install pyenv

```
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

After installation, add following to `.bashrc`:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"

eval "$(pyenv init --path)"

eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

Run .bashrc to get things updated: `source ~/.bashrc`

### Start the project

Install python 3.12.\* if you have a different version locally:

```
pyenv install 3.12.0

pyenv global 3.12.0
```

Confirm your python version: `python --version`

Install the packages using following.

```
poetry install
```

Start the project:

```
poetry shell
```

To run the app:

```
streamlit run seed_vault/ui/main.py
```

Alternatively, command line is configured for this project. You can also run the app, simply by:

```
seed-vault start
```

## Build Project

### Build Python Library

```
poetry build
```

### Build Installers

_Need to be added_

## Docker Development

To develop and run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Install Docker Application on your system

### Build and Run the Docker Container

1. Navigate to the project root directory:

```bash
cd seed-vault
```

2. Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The application should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Export poetry packages to requirements.txt

```
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes
```

## Publishing the lib to test: pypi

Define a package name in pyproject.toml (e.g. `seed-vault`).
Then, run following commands

```bash
poetry build
poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
poetry config pypi-token.test-pypi <YOUR PYPI TOKEN>
poetry publish -r testpypi
```

To install from pypi-test:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple seed-vault
```

Note: include both `test` and `official` indexes.

## Publishing the lib to official: pypi:

```
poetry build
poetry config pypi-token.pypi <YOUR_PYPI_TOKEN>
poetry publish
```

## Unit test

The repository includes a number of unit tests. These tests only covers
the main functions in `seed_vault.service.seismoloader` as these are the
core logics adopted in the app.

### Run tests

To run the test units:

1. Running only mockup tests

```
poetry run pytest
```

2. Running tests with actual FDSN API calls

```
poetry run pytest --run-real-fdsn
```

3. Generate coverage report:

**to include the whole module:**

```
poetry run pytest --run-real-fdsn --cov=seed_vault --cov-report=html
```

**to only include `service/*` tests:**

```
poetry run pytest --run-real-fdsn --cov=seed_vault --cov-config=.coveragerc --cov-report=html
```

4. Generate coverage badge

```
poetry run coverage-badge -o coverage.svg
```
