"""Tools for managing object and datastream metadata in CSV files for GAMS projects.

This package provides utilities to read, write, validate, and manipulate metadata stored in
`object.csv` and `datastreams.csv` files, which accompany GAMS bags but are not part of the 
bag itself.

Main components:

  - ObjectCSVManager: Manages metadata for a single object and its datastreams. Handles 
    reading, writing, validating, merging, and updating CSV files.
  - ObjectCollection: Aggregates metadata from multiple objects into a single CSV file and 
    distributes updates back to individual object directories. Useful for batch editing and 
    synchronization.
  - dublincore: Functions for accessing and processing Dublin Core metadata from 'DC.xml' files,
    including language preference utilities.
  - create_csv: Initializes CSV files for all objects in a project.
  - manage_csv: Collects metadata from all objects into a single CSV for efficient editing, 
    and updates individual object directories from the aggregated data.
  - xlsx: Converts CSV files to XLSX format and vice versa, enabling spreadsheet-based editing and
    avoiding encoding issues common with CSV imports/exports.
