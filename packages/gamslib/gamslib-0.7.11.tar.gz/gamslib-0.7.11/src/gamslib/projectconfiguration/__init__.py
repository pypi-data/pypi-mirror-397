"""GAMS Project Configuration Management.

This module provides tools to locate, validate, and load project configuration files 
for GAMS projects.
Supported sources include `project.toml`, `.env`, and environment variables, with a 
clear precedence order.

Main features:

  - Automatic discovery of configuration files.
  - Validation of configuration structure and values.
  - Access to configuration data as Python objects.
  - Layered overrides: `.env` values override `project.toml`, environment variables override both.

Usage:
    Call `get_configuration()` to retrieve the current project configuration.
    If no configuration file is found, `MissingConfigurationException` is raised.

Precedence example:

  - `project.toml`: base configuration.
  - `.env`: overrides values in `project.toml`.
  - Environment variables: override both `.env` and `project.toml`.

    Load and return the project configuration.

    The configuration is determined in the following order:

      1. If `config_file` is provided, use it.
      2. If the environment variable `GAMSCFG_PROJECT_TOML` is set, use its value 
         as the path.
      3. If a `.env` file exists in the current directory and contains a `project_toml` 
         field, use that.

    Raises:
        MissingConfigurationException: If no configuration file is found.

    Note:
        Values from `project.toml` are overridden by those in `.env`, which are further 
        overridden by environment variables.
        For example:

          - `project.toml` sets `metadata.publisher = "foo"` → used by default.
          - `.env` sets `metadata.publisher = "bar"` → overrides `project.toml`.
          - Environment variable `GAMSCFG_METADATA_PUBLISHER = "baz"` → overrides both.
