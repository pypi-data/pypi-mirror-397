"""
NumPy convenience functions for ztensor.

This module provides a safetensors-compatible API for saving and loading
NumPy arrays in the ztensor format.

Example:
    >>> from ztensor.numpy import save_file, load_file
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> tensors = {"embedding": np.zeros((512, 1024))}
    >>> save_file(tensors, "model.zt")
    >>> loaded = load_file("model.zt")

    """
    Saves a dictionary of tensors into `filename` in ztensor format.

    Args:
        tensor_dict: The incoming tensors. Tensors need to be contiguous and dense.
        filename: The filename we're saving into.
        metadata: Optional text only metadata you might want to save in your
            header. For instance it can be useful to specify more about the
            underlying tensors. This is purely informative and does not
            affect tensor loading.

            parameter is accepted for API compatibility with safetensors

    Returns:
