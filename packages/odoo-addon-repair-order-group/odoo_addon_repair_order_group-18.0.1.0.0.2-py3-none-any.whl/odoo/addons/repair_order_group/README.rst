This module allows to group several repair orders, managing them in a
more convenient way. Such orders are synchronised in the following
actions:

- Partner selection. When a partner is updated in one of the group
  orders the same partner is set in all other orders of the same group.
- Order confirmation. When one of the orders is confirmed all other
  orders of the same group are confirmed.
- Order cancellation. When one of the orders is cancelled all other
  orders of the same group are cancelled.
- Quotation creation. When a new quotation is created all orders of the
  same group are added to the same quotation.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Sometimes you need to create several repair orders in a row while
linking them to the same quotation. For example a service facility
receptionist needs to receive several items from the same client and
then prepare a sales order for all of them at once.

Currently this can be done from the sales order by adding products that
create repair orders on confirmation. However this approach has
limitations, because it makes it difficult to enter some repair details,
e.g. picking a serial number or filling in custom fields in the repair
order form.

Usage
=====

Create the first repair order. Click the "Add Another Repair" button in
the header. A new order will be created with the same partner and same
order group.
