This module allows to group several repair orders, managing them in a more convenient way. Such orders are synchronised in the following actions:

- Partner selection. When a partner is updated in one of the group orders the same partner is set in all other orders of the same group.
- Order confirmation. When one of the orders is confirmed all other orders of the same group are confirmed.
- Order cancellation. When one of the orders is cancelled all other orders of the same group are cancelled.
- Quotation creation. When a new quotation is created all orders of the same group are added to the same quotation.
