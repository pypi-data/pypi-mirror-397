The functions for calculating area are squareArea, circleArea and rectArea.

squareArea calculates the area of a square, there is one argument, it should be the length of one side of the square.

circleArea calculates the area of a circle, there is one argument, it should be the radius of the circle.

rectArea calculates the area of a rectangle, there is two arguments, the first one should be one side and the second argument should be the side right next to, it should not be the opposite side.
