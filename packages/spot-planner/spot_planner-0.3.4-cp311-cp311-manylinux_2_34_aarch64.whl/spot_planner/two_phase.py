"""Two-phase algorithm for handling longer price sequences (> 28 items).

This module implements a two-phase approach:
1. Rough planning: Create averages of price groups, run brute-force on averages
   to determine approximate distribution of selections.
2. Fine-grained planning: Process actual prices in chunks, using the rough plan
   to guide target selections per chunk, with boundary-aware constraint handling
   and look-ahead optimization.

    Extended algorithm for longer price sequences (> 28 items).

    Uses a two-phase approach:
    1. Rough planning: Create averages of price groups, run brute-force on averages
       to determine approximate distribution of selections.
    2. Fine-grained planning: Process actual prices in chunks, using the rough plan
       to guide target selections per chunk, with boundary-aware constraint handling
       and look-ahead optimization.

    The algorithm maintains constraints across chunk boundaries:
    - If a chunk ends with an incomplete consecutive block, the next chunk must
      continue that block to meet min_consecutive_periods.
    - max_gap_between_periods is tracked across boundaries by adjusting
      max_gap_from_start for subsequent chunks.

    Look-ahead optimization:
    - For each chunk, multiple selection strategies are evaluated
    - The cost of forced selections in the next chunk is considered
    - The strategy with lowest combined cost is chosen

    Chunk size is adaptively determined based on sequence length and constraints
    to optimize the performance/optimality trade-off.
