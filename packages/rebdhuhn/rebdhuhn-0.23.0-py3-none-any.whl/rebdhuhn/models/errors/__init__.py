class GraphTooComplexForPlantumlError(PlantumlConversionError):
    """
    Exception raised when a Graph is too complex to convert with PlantUML.

    To understand what this means exactly, we first define the term "last common ancestor" (LCA in the following).
    Let V be an arbitrary node with indegree > 1.
    Define K_arr as the set of all possible paths K_i from the root node ("Start") to V.
    The LCA of V is the node in K_i which is the last common node (orientation is "Start" -> V)
    of all paths in K_arr. I.e. the node where the paths of K_arr split.

    The definition of the LCA is pictured in `src/last_common_ancestor.svg`.

    The graph is too complex for PlantUML if there are multiple different nodes V with the same LCA.
    This is also pictured in `src/plantuml_not_convertable.svg`.

    Example: E_0210 has node 300 which is the LCA for both node 310 (indegree 5) and node 380
    (indegree 4). PlantUML's if/else syntax only supports one "endif" merge point per "if" block,
    so when a single common ancestor needs to merge multiple different nodes, it cannot be
    represented in PlantUML.

    Note: The DOT/Graphviz pipeline handles these complex graphs without issues.
    Use `convert_graph_to_dot()` instead for EBDs that raise this error.
