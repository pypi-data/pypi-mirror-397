    # pyenv
    #   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
    #   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
    # .python-version

    # pipenv
    #   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
    #   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
    #   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
    #   install all needed dependencies.
    #Pipfile.lock

    # UV
    #   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control.
    #   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
    #   commonly ignored for libraries.

    # poetry
    #   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.

    # pdm
    #   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
    #   pdm recommends including project-wide configuration in pdm.toml, but excluding .pdm-python.

    #   Pixi creates a virtual environment in the .pixi directory, just like venv module creates one
    #   in the .venv directory. It is recommended not to include this directory in version control.

    🚀 This project was generated using the **nrobo** testing framework.

    nrobo enables scalable, modular, and cross-type automation (UI, API, performance, E2E) with a clean folder structure and configurable test setup.

    ## 📁 Folder Overview

    - `configs/`: Test configuration files (e.g., environments, base URLs, credentials)
    - `common/`: Shared helper and utility modules (`helpers/`, `utils/`)
    - `data/`: Test fixtures, static payloads, mock data
    - `docs/`: Documentation, test plans, framework usage guidelines
    - `pages/`: Page Object Model classes (for UI abstraction)
    - `tests/`: All test cases, organized by type:
      - `tests/ui/`
      - `tests/api/`
      - `tests/mobile/`
      - `tests/e2e/`
      - `tests/unit/`
      - `tests/integration/`
      - `tests/performance/`
    - `test_suites/`: All test suites, organized by type:
      - `test_suites/ui/`
      - `test_suites/api/`
      - `test_suites/mobile/`
      - `test_suites/e2e/`
      - `test_suites/unit/`
      - `test_suites/integration/`
      - `test_suites/performance/`
    - `test_artifacts/`: Auto-generated test run output:
      - `logs/`, `screenshots/`, `videos/`, `reports/`

    ---

    ## 🧪 Test Suite Format (YAML)

    ```yml
    suite_name: "Your Suite Name"
    tags: [ui, regression]
    priority: high
    owner: frontend-team
    tests:
      - test_login
      - test_get_user
      - test_create_post
    ```

    ---

    ## ⚙️ Installation

    Install project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Optionally, set up a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows
    ```

    ---

    ## 🚦 Running Tests

    Run all tests:

    ```bash
    nrobo            # Run tests in sequence
    nrobo -n auto    # Run tests in parallel
    ```

    Run specific suite:

    ```bash
    nrobo --suite smoke
    ```

    Run only API tests:

    ```bash
    nrobo api
    ```

    Generate test artifacts and reports:

    ```bash
    nrobo            # By default, generates HTML + Allure reports
    ```

    ---

    ## 🌐 Environment Configuration

    All environment-specific variables are stored in `configs/`:

    ```yaml
    # configs/env_dev.yaml
    base_url: "https://dev.example.com"
    username: "testuser"
    password: "secret"
    ```

    Specify which config to use:

    ```bash
    nrobo --env dev
    ```

    ---

    ## 🔁 Suggested CI Integration

    In `.github/workflows/test.yml`:

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: nrobo -n auto

      - name: Upload artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: test-report
          path: test_artifacts/reports/
    ```

    ---

    ## ✅ Best Practices

    - Keep `common/` lean and reusable — no hard-coded envs or data.
    - Store sensitive values in `.env` or encrypted config if needed.
    - Document all custom test flows in `docs/` for easy team collaboration.
    - Clean up `test_artifacts/` between CI runs to avoid stale results.
