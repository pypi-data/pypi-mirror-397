# API: Permits

This page documents the available recovery permit strategies. Permit strategies control how many "probe" calls are allowed to pass through during the `HALF_OPEN` state to test for service recovery.

For a high-level guide on choosing a permit strategy, see the [Permits Component Guide](../components/permits.md).
