def install_packages(*packages: str, with_sudo: bool = False) -> str:
    """
    This function returns a shell command which checks which Linux package manger is available
    and installs a package. This is useful if you want to install a package within a Gitlab
    job but did not know on which system the job will be running on.

    Currently supported are apk, apt-get, yum, dnf and zypper.

    The drawback of this function is, that it only supports one package name. So if different
    package managers have different names for a package, this script will fail.
