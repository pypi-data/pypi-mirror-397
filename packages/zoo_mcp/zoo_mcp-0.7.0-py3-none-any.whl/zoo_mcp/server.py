    - You can use verbs like "design a..." or "create a...", but those aren't needed. Prompting "A gear" works as well as "Create a gear".
    - If your prompt omits important dimensions, Text-to-CAD will make its best guess to fill in missing details.
    - Traditional, simple mechanical parts such as fasteners, bearings and connectors work best right now.
    - Text-to-CAD returns a 422 error code if it fails to generate a valid geometry internally, even if it understands your prompt. We're working on reducing the amount of errors.
    - Shorter prompts, 1-2 sentences in length, succeed more often than longer prompts.
    - The maximum prompt length is approximately 6000 words. Generally, shorter prompts of one or two sentences work best. Longer prompts take longer to resolve.
    - The same prompt can generate different results when submitted multiple times. Sometimes a failing prompt will succeed on the next attempt, and vice versa.

    # Examples
    - "A 21-tooth involute helical gear."
    - "A plate with a hole in each corner for a #10 bolt. The plate is 4" wide, 6" tall."
    - "A dodecahedron."
    - "A camshaft."
    - "A 1/2 inch gear with 21 teeth."
    - "A 3x6 lego."

        prompt (str): The text prompt to be realized as KCL code.

    Returns:
        str: The generated KCL code if Text-to-CAD is successful, otherwise the error message.

    # General Tips
    - You can use verbs like "add", "remove", "change", "make", "fillet", etc. to describe the modification you want to make.
    - Be specific about what you want to change in the model. For example, "add a hole to the center" is more specific than "add a hole".

                    Each key in the dict refers to a KCL file path relative to the project path, and each value is the complete KCL code for that file.
