EMBEDL MODELS COMMUNITY LICENSE AGREEMENT
v.1.0

Embedl is pleased to make available Embedl-optimized AI models and accompanying tools, SDKs, and source code files under this Community License Agreement (the "License" or the "Terms"). Our goal is to foster a vibrant community of developers, researchers, and organizations who can freely use, modify, and build upon these optimized AI models and tools. To that end, this license permits unlimited use, distribution and commercialization for most individuals and organizations, subject only to the limited restrictions described below.

To sustain our ability to continue developing and releasing optimized AI models, we have established three limitations on use. First, competitors to Embedl may not use the licensed materials, as permitting such use would undermine our ability to invest in future development. Second, larger organizations—those with more than 250 employees or annual revenue exceeding €10 million—can use the licensed materials for internal evaluation purposes, but must obtain a separate Commercial Use license before using the licensed materials for commercial purposes; this ensures that entities with greater resources contribute appropriately to the ecosystem. Third, no licensee may host the licensed materials as a service, which protects both Embedl's interests and the integrity of the community by preventing commoditization of these models (although specific use cases are possible with prior approval from us).

We recognize that individual circumstances vary, and we welcome inquiries from those who wish to discuss alternative licensing arrangements that fall outside these terms. Please contact Embedl at  legal@embedl.com to discuss your specific use case. We would be happy to work with you.

Liability for damages will be so limited and excluded, regardless of the validity or efficacy of any remedy provided herein and even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, intentional misconduct, or gross negligence, or any other liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law.

5.0	TERMINATION

5.1	Upon Breach. The licenses granted by these Terms will terminate automatically if you are in breach of these Terms, including if you exceed the scope of the licenses granted in section 2.0. Breach of these Terms may result in pursuit of all available remedies for intellectual property rights (including intellectual property rights infringement), the availability of which you hereby acknowledge.

5.2	Upon Litigation. The license rights set forth in section 2.0 will terminate automatically if you institute litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) against any entity alleging that the use, distribution, modification, sale, offer to sell, transfer or import of the Embedl Models, any Contribution (alone or in combination), or the outputs or results of the Embedl Models, constitutes direct, indirect, vicarious, or contributory infringement of intellectual property rights. 

5.3	By Us. We may on written notice terminate rights granted under these Terms in the event the Embedl Models become subject to third party claims of infringement or violation of intellectual property or other rights or applicable law. 

5.4	Effect. Upon termination of rights for any reason, all licensed rights granted under these Terms will terminate, and you will immediately cease all use, and destroy all and not retain any copies, of the Embedl Models. Our rights under this section 5.0 are in addition to any other rights and remedies permitted by law or under these Terms.

6.0	GENERAL PROVISIONS

6.1	Governing Law. These Terms and any disputes between us and related to or concerning these Terms or the Embedl Models (including tort as well as contract claims, and whether pre-contractual or extra-contractual), notwithstanding the choice of laws rules of any jurisdiction to the contrary, will be governed by the procedural and substantive laws of Sweden. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply and is hereby excluded. 

6.2 	Arbitration. Subject to section 6.3, any disputes between or claims brought by either party arising out of or related to the Embedl Models or these Terms shall be referred to and finally settled exclusively by binding arbitration before the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (the "SCC"), and the venue for arbitration will be Stockholm, Sweden. The Rules for Expedited Arbitrations will apply, unless the SCC in its discretion determines, taking into account the complexity of the case, the amount in dispute and other circumstances, that the Arbitration Rules will apply. In the latter case, the SCC will also decide whether the Arbitral Tribunal will be composed of one or three arbitrators. The arbitration will be conducted by telephone, on-line and/or based solely upon written submissions where no in-person appearance is required. If in-person appearance is required, such hearings will be held in Stockholm, Sweden. The arbitrator will apply the law specified in section 6.1. All awards may if necessary be enforced by any court having jurisdiction. The existence of any dispute, the existence or details of the arbitration proceeding, and all related documents, materials, evidence, judgments and awards therein, shall be kept confidential. Except as required by law, no party will make any public announcements with respect to the other party or the proceeding or the award, except as required to enforce same. All disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions. Subject to section 6.3, all claims between the parties must be resolved via arbitration in accordance with this section. Should either party file an action contrary to this section, the other party may recover lawyers' fees and costs associated with enforcing this section, provided that the party seeking the award has notified the other party in writing of the improperly filed claim, and the other party has failed to withdraw the claim in a timely fashion. 

6.3	Injunctive Relief; Prevailing Party. You acknowledge and agree that breach of these Terms, or any unauthorized use or distribution of the Embedl Models, may cause irreparable harm to us, the extent of which would be difficult to ascertain, and that we will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief and specific performance (in addition to any other available remedies), and to enforce and/or seek redress for infringement of intellectual property rights, in any court of competent jurisdiction under the applicable laws thereto (and such proceeding, and our right to prosecute such a claim, is not subject to arbitration). You hereby consent to the jurisdiction of such courts for any such actions. A party prevailing in any litigation or arbitration related to these Terms or the Embedl Models will be entitled, in addition to such other relief as may be granted, to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees. This section is in addition and without prejudice to the availability of attorneys' fees as a remedy under applicable law, including laws pertaining to intellectual property rights.

6.4	Important Final Terms. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us and govern your use of the Embedl Models, superseding any prior agreements, understandings, communications or proposals; except that these Terms do not override, supersede, or modify the terms of any written license agreement signed by you and us. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of these Terms will be deemed a further waiver or continuing waiver or such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Nothing herein will be deemed to create an agency, partnership, joint venture, or franchisor-franchisee relationship of any kind between us and any user or other person or entity, nor do these terms extend rights to any third party. These Terms are in the English language only, which language will be controlling in all respects, and all versions of these Terms in any other language will be for accommodation only and will not be binding on you or us.
