This module extends the report configuration in order to display HTML
content inside Report Footer on chosen reports.

Implementation Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The footer is injected into various report layouts. In some cases, the
native footer div is **replaced** instead of just adding content before
it:

- **``Bubble``**: The div is replaced to move the vertical separator bar
  that splits the footer content, ensuring a clean layout with the
  custom footer displayed above the native one.

- **``Standard``, ``Folder``, ``Boxed`` and ``Bold``**: The div is
  replaced and the footer layout is modified to ensure the HTML footer
  content occupies the full width instead of appearing inline with other
  elements.

In other layouts (``striped``, ``wave``), the custom footer is simply
inserted before the native footer without replacing it, as the layout
structure handles the distribution correctly.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
