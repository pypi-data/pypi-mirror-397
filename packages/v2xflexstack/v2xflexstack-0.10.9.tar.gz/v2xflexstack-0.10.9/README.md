# Short description

FlexStack(R) is a software library implementing the ETSI C-ITS protocol stack. Its aim is to facilitate and accelerate the development and integration of software applications on vehicles, vulnerable road users (VRU), and roadside infrastructure that requires the exchange of V2X messages (compliant with ETSI standards) with other actors of the V2X ecosystem.

# Documentation

Extensive documentation is available at [https://flexstack.eu](https://flexstack.eu).

# Pre-requisites

## Supported Operating Systems

This library can run on any system that supports Python 3.8 or higher.

It's important to remark that depending on the Access and Physical layer used, the library may requires additional dependencies.
As an example, it comes with a precompiled version of the C-V2X Link Layer tested on current Cohda Mk6 and other Qualcomm based solutions, which is used to enable the usage of C-V2X directly by this message library. However, if you want to use it with other hardware or software solutions, you may need to cross-compile the C-V2X Link Layer for your specific platform.

## Dependencies

All dependecies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On the Access Layer, the dependencies depends on the Access Technology used. Specific tutorials and examples can be found elsewhere.

## Build tools

The library is built using Python. To build the library, run the following command:

```
python -m build
```

It requires the `setuptools` and `wheel` packages. If they are not installed, they can be installed using the following command:

```
pip install build setuptools wheel
```

## Known Limitations

- The ASN.1 compiler used in this library is `asn1tools`, which has some limitations. For example, it does not support the `ANY` type, which is used in some ETSI C-ITS messages. This means that some messages may have undergone some adaptations to be compatible with the library. Although this simplifications have been tested with existing commercial implementations, and everything works as expected, it is important to be aware of this limitation.

# Installation

Library can be easily installed using the following command:

```
pip install v2xflexstack
```
