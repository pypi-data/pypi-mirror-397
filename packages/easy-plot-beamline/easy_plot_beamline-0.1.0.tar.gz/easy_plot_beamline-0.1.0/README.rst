To view the basic usage and available commands, type ::

        easyplot -h

Getting Started
---------------

Once installed, you can use the ``easyplot`` CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

        # Overlay multiple files
        easyplot file1.gr file2.gr

        # Waterfall plot with spacing
        easyplot data/ --waterfall --yspace=2

        # Pairwise difference matrix
        easyplot data/ --diffmatrix --yspace=1.5

        # Direct difference between two files
        easyplot file1.gr file2.gr --diff

        # Get help
        easyplot -h


Support and Contribute
----------------------

If you see a bug or want to request a feature, please `report it as an issue <https://github.com/cadenmyers13/easy-plot-beamline/issues>`_ and/or `submit a fix as a PR <https://github.com/cadenmyers13/easy-plot-beamline/pulls>`_.

Feel free to fork the project and contribute. To install easy-plot-beamline
in a development mode, with its sources being directly used by Python
rather than copied to a package directory, use the following in the root
directory ::

        pip install -e .

To ensure code quality and to prevent accidental commits into the default branch, please set up the use of our pre-commit
hooks.

1. Install pre-commit in your working environment by running ``conda install pre-commit``.

2. Initialize pre-commit (one time only) ``pre-commit install``.

Thereafter your code will be linted by black and isort and checked against flake8 before you can commit.
If it fails by black or isort, just rerun and it should pass (black and isort will modify the files so should
pass after they are modified). If the flake8 test fails please see the error messages and fix them manually before
trying to commit again.

Improvements and fixes are always appreciated.
