        These notes do not add terms or alter the MIT License. If there is any

        - Purpose of interoperability: This Software may be used to read, write, or
          convert third-party file formats in order to enable compatibility with other
          tools and to allow users access to their own data.
        
        - No third-party proprietary code: This Software contains no code copied from,
          and is not derived from, proprietary software of any third-party vendor. It
          operates only on user-generated data files.
        
        - Reverse-engineering of data formats: In many jurisdictions, analyzing file
          formats for interoperability or user data access is recognized as lawful
          (e.g., EU software directive–based interoperability exceptions; U.S. fair
          use cases). This note is informational and not legal advice.
        
        - No affiliation: This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by any
          third-party software vendor whose file formats may be read or written.

# Welcome to py4cst!

This is a small python library that provides wrappers for CST Studio Suite python library as well as some useful high level tools to setup your projects and to read out the results.

**Be aware the library in it's current state is highly untested and will change a lot even in it's core. Any contributions are welcome!**

## Update 0.2.0

Added VBA mappings. VBA wrappers are now generated automatically from TOML files, including documentation.

# Usage

Check the *examples* directory.
