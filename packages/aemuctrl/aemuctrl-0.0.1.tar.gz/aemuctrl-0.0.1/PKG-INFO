# aemuctrl (v0.0.1)

A lightweight Python utility for controlling Android emulators and devices via ADB and PyAutoGUI. "aemuctrl" focuses on simplifying automation, screen management, and emulator-specific interactions.

## 📥 ADB Installation Guides

To use this library, you must have ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed on your system. Please follow the tutorials below based on your operating system:

* **Windows Setup:** [Watch Installation Guide](https://youtu.be/JQrMvecOAeE?si=M1VjuHDDC2-NLDZ9)
* **macOS Setup:** [Watch Installation Guide](https://youtu.be/k58GSn3pRTY?si=1WiDM0bW9VJ-Sg_L)

## 🎮 Emulator Zoom Configuration (CRITICAL)

The zoom functions in **aemuctrl** work by interacting with the emulator's software shortcuts. To prevent system-level conflicts and ensure scripts run correctly, you **must** manually assign the following hotkeys in your emulator settings (BlueStacks, Nox, MeMu, etc.):

* **Zoom IN:** Assign the letter **"B"**
* **Zoom OUT:** Assign the letter **"S"**

> **Note:** These specific assignments are required for `zoom_in()`, `zoom_out()`, `human_zoom_in()`, and `human_zoom_out()` to function.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Smart Connectivity:** Automatically scans and connects to common emulator ports (5554-5565, 62001, 21503, etc.).
* **Fast Screen Capture:** Uses `exec-out` for high-speed screenshot transfer without writing to the device's internal storage first.
* **Safe Text Entry:** Automatically replaces spaces with `%s` to ensure ADB inputs are delivered correctly.
* **Human-like Motion:** Includes zoom functions with varied delays to mimic human behavior and avoid detection.

## 📖 Basic Usage

### 1. Connecting
```python
import aemuctrl

# Scans ports and connects to the first available emulator
device = aemuctrl.smart_connect_fallback()

2. Navigation & Touch
Python

aemuctrl.home()
aemuctrl.back()
aemuctrl.tap(x=500, y=500)
aemuctrl.swipe(100, 100, 500, 500, duration=300)

3. Screen & Apps
Python

# Launch an app by package name
aemuctrl.open_app("com.android.settings")

# Take a high-speed screenshot
aemuctrl.screenshot("view.png")

4. Zoom Control (Requires B/S Mapping)
Python

# Standard Zoom
aemuctrl.zoom_in() 

# Human-like natural zoom out (Uses 'S' key)
aemuctrl.human_zoom_out()

⚙️ Configuration

If your ADB executable is not in the system environment variables (PATH), update the ADB_PATH at the top of the file: ADB_PATH = "C:/path/to/adb.exe"
