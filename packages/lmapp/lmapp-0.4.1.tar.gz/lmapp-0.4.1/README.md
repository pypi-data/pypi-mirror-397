╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║        Chat with Mistral (Local)           ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝

You: Explain quantum computing in simple terms

AI: Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) instead of regular bits.
While regular bits are 0 or 1, qubits can be both at once (superposition).
This lets them solve certain problems exponentially faster...

You: What are the use cases?

AI: Key use cases include:
  • Drug discovery (molecular simulation)
  • Finance (portfolio optimization)
  • Cryptography (breaking encryption)
  • Machine learning (optimization)
```

### � VS Code Integration
Turn VS Code into an AI-powered IDE with our extension.

1. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   lmapp server start
   ```
2. **Open Dashboard**: Go to `http://localhost:8000` to see status and chat.
3. **Install Extension**: Install `lmapp-vscode` (coming soon to marketplace).
4. **Enjoy**: Get inline code completions and chat directly in your editor.

## 🌟 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: No Internet? No Problem!
**Scenario:** Camping, road trip, flight, deployment - anywhere without internet  
**Question:** "Why does the sky look blue?"

```bash
$ lmapp chat
> AI: Hello, how may I help you?
> You: Why does the sky look blue?

> AI: Short answer: the sky is blue because air molecules scatter 
     sunlight more strongly at short (blue) wavelengths than at long 
     (red) wavelengths — a process called Rayleigh scattering.

     A bit more detail:
     • Sunlight contains all visible colors
     • Rayleigh scattering scales as 1/λ^4
     • Blue light (~450 nm) scattered many times more than red (~650 nm)
     • At sunrise/sunset, blue light scattered out → sky looks red/orange
     • Clouds look white (Mie scattering of larger water droplets)
     
     Extra neat fact: scattered sky light is partially polarized!

> AI: Is there anything else I can help you with?
```

**Key Point:** Full scientific answers WITHOUT internet

### Example 2: Gaming Power User
**Scenario:** Playing GTA San Andreas, need cheat codes and tips

```bash
$ lmapp chat
> You: I'm playing GTA San Andreas, show me cheat codes and top 20 tips

> AI: Nice! Which platform? (PC, PS2/3/4/5, Xbox)
> You: PC

> AI: Here are PC cheat codes (type during gameplay):
     HESOYAM - Health, Armor, $250,000
     AEZAKMI - Never Wanted
     BAGUVIX - Infinite Health
     FULLCLIP - Infinite Ammo
     [20+ more codes...]

     Top 20 Tips & Tricks:
     1. Save often — use multiple save slots
     2. Complete side jobs for cash/stat boosts (Ambulance, Firefighter)
     3. Grind stats: stamina, muscle, driving/flying skill
     4. Learn weapon ranges, aim for headshots
     5. Keep Armor on you at all times
