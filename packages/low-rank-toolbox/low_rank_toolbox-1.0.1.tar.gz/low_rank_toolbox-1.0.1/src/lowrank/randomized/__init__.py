"""Randomized algorithms for low-rank matrix approximation.

This submodule implements state-of-the-art randomized algorithms for computing
low-rank approximations of large matrices, based on the seminal work by
Halko, Martinsson, and Tropp (2010).

Functions
---------
rangefinder : Approximate the range of a dense matrix with a target rank
adaptive_rangefinder : Approximate the range of a dense matrix with a target tolerance
randomized_svd : Implementation of the randomized SVD algorithm with a prescribed rank
adaptive_randomized_svd : Adaptive randomized SVD with tolerance-based rank selection
generalized_nystrom : Generalized Nyström method for low-rank approximation
