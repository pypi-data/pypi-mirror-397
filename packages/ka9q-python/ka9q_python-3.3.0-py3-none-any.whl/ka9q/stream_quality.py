"""
Stream Quality Metadata for ka9q-python

Provides data structures for tracking stream quality and gap information.
This metadata accompanies sample streams delivered to applications.

Gap Types (detected by ka9q-python core):
- NETWORK_LOSS: RTP packets lost in transit (sequence gap)
- RESEQUENCE_TIMEOUT: Packet arrived too late to resequence
- EMPTY_PAYLOAD: RTP packet received with no data
- STREAM_START: Gap at beginning before first packet
- STREAM_INTERRUPTION: radiod stopped sending packets

Applications may add their own gap types (e.g., cadence_fill, late_start)
when they perform segmentation.
