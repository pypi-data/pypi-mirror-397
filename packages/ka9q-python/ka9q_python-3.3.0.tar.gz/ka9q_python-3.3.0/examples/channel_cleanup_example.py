Example: Proper Channel Cleanup Patterns

This example demonstrates best practices for removing channels when done
to prevent radiod from accumulating unused channel instances.

IMPORTANT: Always remove channels in your downstream applications!

NOTE: Channel removal is ASYNCHRONOUS. Setting frequency to 0 marks the
channel for removal, and radiod periodically polls to remove marked channels.
The channel may still appear in discovery for a brief time after calling
remove_channel(). This is normal radiod behavior.
