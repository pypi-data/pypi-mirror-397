        Parameters
        ----------
        stf : Stf
            The sampleable function :math:`v(t)` to discretize. The values of the

            The duration :math:`\tau` over which discretization should be
            performed. The resulting piecewise-constant function has this
            duration.
        segment_count : int

        Graph.sample_stf : Sample an `Stf` at given times.

        Notes
        -----
        The resulting function :math:`w(t)` is piecewise-constant with :math:`N`
        segments, meaning it has segment values :math:`\{w_n\}` such that

        Notes
        -----
        The sinc kernel that this node represents is defined as

        .. math::
            K(t) = \frac{\sin(\omega_c t)}{\pi t}.

        In the frequency domain, the sinc function is constant in the range
        :math:`[-\omega_c, \omega_c]` and zero elsewhere. The filter it represents therefore
        passes angular frequencies only in that range.

        Create a convolution kernel representing a normalized Gaussian.

        Use this kernel to allow angular frequencies in the range roughly determined by
        its width, and progressively suppress components outside that range.

        Parameters
        ----------
        std : float or Tensor
            Standard deviation :math:`\sigma` of the Gaussian in the time domain.
            The standard deviation in the frequency domain is its inverse, so that
            a high value of this parameter lets fewer angular frequencies pass.
        offset : float or Tensor, optional
            Center :math:`\mu` of the Gaussian distribution in the time domain.
            Use this to offset the signal in time. Defaults to 0.

        Returns
        -------
        ConvolutionKernel
            A node representing a Gaussian function to use in a convolution.

        --------
        Graph.convolve_pwc : Create an `Stf` by convolving a `Pwc` with a kernel.
        Graph.sinc_convolution_kernel : Create a convolution kernel representing the sinc function.

        Notes
        -----
        The Gaussian kernel that this node represents is defined as:

        .. math::
            K(t) = \frac{e^{-(t-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}.

        In the frequency domain, this Gaussian has standard deviation
        :math:`\omega_c= \sigma^{-1}`. The filter it represents therefore
        passes angular frequencies roughly in the range :math:`[-\omega_c, \omega_c]`.
