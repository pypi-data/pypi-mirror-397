        Calculate the cost for robust optimization of a Mølmer–Sørensen gate.

        Add the tensor that this function returns to the infidelity of your
        target operation to obtain a cost that you can use to create a
        Mølmer–Sørensen gate that is robust against dephasing noise. You can
        further multiply the robust cost by a scaling factor to weigh how much
        importance you give to the robustness compared to the original cost.

        Parameters
        ----------
        drives : list[Pwc or None]
            The piecewise-constant drives, :math:`\{\gamma_j\}`, one for each of the :math:`N` ions.
            Drive values must be in rad/s and durations must be in seconds.
            All drives must have the same total duration, but can have different segmentations.
            If an ion is not addressed, you can pass None for its drive (this leads to a
            more efficient calculation than passing a zero drive).
        lamb_dicke_parameters : np.ndarray
            The laser-ion coupling strength, :math:`\{\eta_{jkl}\}`.
            Its shape must be ``(3, N, N)``, where the dimensions indicate,
            respectively, axis, collective mode, and ion.
        relative_detunings : np.ndarray
            The difference :math:`\{\delta_{jk} = \nu_{jk} - \delta\}` (in Hz) between each motional
            mode frequency and the laser detuning from the qubit transition frequency
            :math:`\omega_0`. Its shape must be ``(3, N)``, where the dimensions indicate,
            respectively, axis and collective mode.
        name : str or None, optional
            The name of the node.

        Returns
        -------
        Tensor(scalar, real)
            The cost term that you can use to optimize a Mølmer–Sørensen gate
            that is robust against dephasing noise. The cost is the sum of the
            square moduli of the time-averaged positions of the phase-space
            trajectories, weighted by the corresponding Lamb–Dicke parameters.

        See Also
        --------
        :func:`Graph.ions.ms_infidelity <ions.ms_infidelity>`
            Final operational infidelity of a Mølmer–Sørensen gate.
        :func:`boulderopal.ions.obtain_ion_chain_properties`
            Function to calculate the properties of an ion chain.

        Notes
        -----
        You can construct a Mølmer–Sørensen gate that is robust against
        dephasing noise by a combination of minimizing the time-averaged
        positions of the phase-space trajectories and imposing a symmetry in
        each ion's drive [1]_.

        The displacement of the :math:`l`-th ion in the :math:`k`-th mode of
        oscillation in dimension :math:`j` is [2]_

        .. math::
            \alpha_{jkl}(t) = \int_0^t d\tau \frac{\gamma_l(\tau)}{2}
                    \exp(i 2 \pi \delta_{jk} \tau) .

        For a gate of duration :math:`t_\text{gate}`, the time-averaged displacement is

        .. math::
            \langle \alpha_{jkl} \rangle = \frac{1}{t_\text{gate}}
                    \int_0^{t_\text{gate}} \alpha_{jkl}(t) \mathrm{d} t .

        This function returns the sum of the square moduli of the time-averaged
        positions multiplied by the corresponding Lamb–Dicke parameters. These
        parameters weight the time-averaged positions in the same way that the
        :math:`\alpha_{jkl}(t)` are weighted in the formula for the infidelity
        of a Mølmer–Sørensen gate (see :func:`Graph.ions.ms_infidelity <ions.ms_infidelity>`).

        In other words, the robust cost that this function returns is

        .. math::
            C_\text{robust} = \sum_{j=1}^{3} \sum_{k=1}^{N} \sum_{l=1}^{N}
                \left| \eta_{jkl} \langle \alpha_{jkl} \rangle \right|^2 .

        You can add this to the infidelity with the respect to the target gate
        to create the cost function that optimizes a gate that is also robust
        against dephasing. You can further multiply :math:`C_\text{robust}` by
        a scaling factor to weigh how much importance you give to robustness.

            If you provide it, it must be 1D, ordered, and contain at least one element.
            If you omit it, the displacements are only calculated at the final time of the drives.
        name : str or None, optional
            The name of the node.

        Returns
        -------
        Tensor(complex)
            Displacements :math:`\{\eta_{jkl}\alpha_{jkl}(t_i)\}` for all mode-ion combinations.
            If you provide `sample_times`, the shape of the returned value is ``(T, 3, N, N_d)``,

        Notes

        This function calculates, at sample times :math:`\{t_i\}`, the contribution
        to the displacement of mode :math:`k` in dimension :math:`j` from ion :math:`l`,

        Calculate the relative phases for all pairs of ions described by a Mølmer–Sørensen-type
        interaction when single-tone individually-addressed laser beams are used.

        Use this function to calculate the acquired phases for all ion pairs
        at the final time of the drives, or at the sample times that you provide.

        Parameters
        ----------
        drives : list[Pwc or None]
            The piecewise-constant drives, :math:`\{\gamma_j\}`, one for each of the :math:`N` ions.
            Drive values must be in rad/s and durations must be in seconds.
            All drives must have the same total duration, but can have different segmentations.
            This list must contain at least two elements (your system must have at least two ions).
            If an ion is not addressed, you can pass None for its drive (this leads to a
            more efficient calculation than passing a zero drive).
        lamb_dicke_parameters : np.ndarray
            The laser-ion coupling strength, :math:`\{\eta_{jkl}\}`.
            Its shape must be ``(3, N, N)``, where the dimensions indicate,
            respectively, axis, collective mode, and ion.
        relative_detunings : np.ndarray
            The difference :math:`\{\delta_{jk} = \nu_{jk} - \delta\}` (in Hz) between each motional
            mode frequency and the laser detuning from the qubit transition frequency
            :math:`\omega_0`.  Its shape must be ``(3, N)``, where the dimensions indicate,
            respectively, axis and collective mode.
        sample_times : np.ndarray or None, optional
            The times (in seconds) at which to calculate the relative phases, :math:`\{t_i\}`.
            If you provide it, it must be 1D, ordered, and contain at least one element.
            If you omit it, the phases are only calculated at the final time of the drives.
        name : str or None, optional
            The name of the node.

        Returns
        -------
        Tensor(real)
            Acquired phases :math:`\{\phi_{jk}(t_i) + \phi_{kj}(t_i)\}` for all ion pairs.
            If you provide `sample_times`, the shape of the returned value is ``(T, N, N)``,
            where the first dimension indicates time, and the second and third dimensions indicate
            ions. Otherwise, the shape is ``(N, N)``, with the outer time dimension removed.
            The relative phases are stored as a strictly lower triangular matrix.
            See the notes part for details.

                + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \sum_{l=1}^N \frac{\hbar \omega_0}{2} \sigma_{z,l} ,

        where :math:`j` indicates axis dimension (:math:`x`, :math:`y`, or :math:`z`),
        :math:`k` indicates collective mode, :math:`a_{jk}` is the annihilation operator,
        and :math:`\sigma_{z,l}` is the Pauli :math:`Z` operator for ion :math:`l`.

        The interaction Hamiltonian for Mølmer–Sørensen-type
        operations in the rotating frame with respect to :math:`H_0` is

        .. math::

        .. math::
            \beta_{jkl}(t) = \eta_{jkl} \frac{\gamma_l(t)}{2} \exp(i 2 \pi \delta_{jk} t)

        indicates the coupling between ion :math:`l` and motional mode :math:`(j,k)`.

        The corresponding unitary operation is given by [1]_

        .. math::
            U(t) = \exp\left[ \sum_{l=1}^N \sigma_{x,l} B_l(t)

                \sigma_{x,l} \sigma_{x,n} \right] ,

        where

        .. math::
            B_l(t) &\equiv \sum_{j=1}^{3} \sum_{k=1}^{N}
                \left(\eta_{jkl}\alpha_{jkl}(t)a_{jk}^\dagger
                - \eta_{jkl}^{\ast}\alpha_{jkl}^\ast(t)a_{jk} \right) ,

            \phi_{ln}(t) &\equiv \mathrm{Im} \left[ \sum_{j=1}^{3} \sum_{k=1}^{N}
                \int_{0}^{t} d \tau_1 \int_{0}^{\tau_1} d \tau_2
                \beta_{jkl}(\tau_1)\beta_{jkn}^{\ast}(\tau_2) \right] ,

            \alpha_{jkl}(t) &\equiv \int_0^t d\tau \frac{\gamma_l(\tau)}{2}
                \exp(i 2 \pi \delta_{jk} \tau) .

        This function calculates the relative phases for all ions pairs
        at sample times :math:`\{t_i\}`,

        .. math::
            \Phi_{ln}(t_i) = \phi_{ln}(t_i) + \phi_{nl}(t_i),

        and stores them in a strictly lower triangular matrix.
        That is, :math:`\Phi_{ln}(t_i)` with :math:`l > n`
        gives the relative phase between ions :math:`l` and :math:`n`,
        while :math:`\Phi_{ln}(t_i) = 0` for :math:`l \leq n`.
