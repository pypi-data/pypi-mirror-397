    Simulate a system composed of transmons and cavities.

    This function builds a graph describing the Hamiltonian (see the note part for details) of a
    superconducting system, and calls :func:`~boulderopal.execute_graph` to simulate its dynamics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transmons : list[Transmon]
        List of objects containing the physical information about the transmons.
        It must not contain any optimizable coefficients.
        It can be an empty list, but at least one transmon or cavity must be provided.
    cavities : list[Cavity]
        List of objects containing the physical information about the cavities.
        They must not contain any optimizable coefficients.
        It can be an empty list, but at least one transmon or cavity must be provided.
    interactions : list[TransmonTransmonInteraction or TransmonCavityInteraction or \
            CavityCavityInteraction]
        List of objects containing the physical information about the interactions in the system.
        They must not contain any optimizable coefficients.
        It can be an empty list.
    gate_duration : float
        The duration of the gate to be simulated, :math:`t_\\mathrm{gate}`.
        It must be greater than zero.
    sample_count : int, optional
        The number of times between 0 and `gate_duration` (included)
        at which the evolution is sampled.
        Defaults to 128.
    cutoff_frequency : float or None, optional
        The cutoff frequency of a linear sinc filter to be applied to the piecewise-constant
        signals you provide for the coefficients. If not provided, the signals are not filtered.
        If the signals are filtered, a larger sample count leads to a more accurate numerical
        integration. If the signals are not filtered, the sample count has no effect on the
        numerical precision of the integration.
    initial_state : np.ndarray or None, optional
        The initial state of the system, :math:`|\\Psi_\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle`, as a 1D array of
        length ``D = np.prod([system.dimension for system in transmons + cavities])``.
        If not provided, the function only returns the system's unitary time-evolution operators.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The result of the `execute_graph` call.
        Its ``output`` item is a dictionary containing information about
        the evolution of the system, with the following keys:

            ``sample_times``
                The times at which the system's evolution is sampled,
                as an array of shape ``(T,)``.
            ``unitaries``
                The system's unitary time-evolution operators at each sample time,
                as an array of shape ``(T, D, D)``.
            ``state_evolution``
                The time evolution of the initial state at each sample time,
                as an array of shape ``(T, D)``.
                This is only returned if you provide an initial state.

    See Also
    --------
    :func:`boulderopal.superconducting.optimize` :
        Find optimal pulses or parameters for a system composed of transmons and cavities.

    Notes
    -----
    The Hamiltonian of the system is of the form

    .. math::
        H = \\sum_i H_{\\mathrm{transmon}_i}
            + \\sum_i H_{\\mathrm{cavity}_i}
            + \\sum_{i,j} H_{\\mathrm{transmon}_i-\\mathrm{transmon}_j}
            + \\sum_{i,j} H_{\\mathrm{transmon}_i-\\mathrm{cavity}_j}
            + \\sum_{i,j} H_{\\mathrm{cavity}_i-\\mathrm{cavity}_j}

    where i and j mark the i-th and j-th transmon or cavity.
    For their definition of each Hamiltonian term, see its respective class.

    The Hilbert space of the system is defined as the outer product of all the
    transmon Hilbert spaces (in the order they're provided in `transmons`) with
    the cavity Hilbert spaces (in the order they're provided in `cavities`), that is:

    .. math::
        \\mathcal{H} =
            \\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{transmon}_1} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{transmon}_2}
            \\otimes \\ldots
            \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{cavity}_1} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{cavity}_2}
            \\otimes \\ldots

    The system dimension `D` is then the product of all transmon and cavity dimensions.

    """
    Find optimal pulses or parameters for a system composed of transmons and cavities,
    in order to achieve a target state or implement a target operation.

    At least one of the terms in the `transmons`, `cavities`, or `interactions` arguments
    must be optimizable.

    To optimize a state transfer, you need to provide an initial and a target state.
    To optimize a target gate/unitary, you need to provide a target operation.

    This function builds a graph describing the Hamiltonian (see the note part for details) of a
    superconducting system, and calls :func:`~boulderopal.run_optimization` to
    to perform the optimization task.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transmons : list[Transmon]
        List of objects containing the physical information about the transmons.
        It can be an empty list, but at least one transmon or cavity must be provided.
    cavities : list[Cavity]
        List of objects containing the physical information about the cavities.
        It can be an empty list, but at least one transmon or cavity must be provided.
    interactions : list[TransmonTransmonInteraction or TransmonCavityInteraction or \
            CavityCavityInteraction]
        List of objects containing the physical information about the interactions in the system.
        It can be an empty list.
    gate_duration : float
        The duration of the gate to be optimized, :math:`t_\\mathrm{gate}`.
        It must be greater than zero.
    initial_state : np.ndarray or None, optional
        The initial state of the system, :math:`|\\Psi_\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle`, as a 1D array of
        length ``D = np.prod([system.dimension for system in transmon + cavities])``.
        If provided, the function also returns its time evolution.
        This is a required parameter if you pass a `target_state`.
    target_state : np.ndarray or None, optional
        The target state of the optimization, :math:`|\\Psi_\\mathrm{target}\\rangle`,
        as a 1D array of length `D`.
        You must provide exactly one of `target_state` or `target_operation`.
    target_operation : np.ndarray or None, optional
        The target operation of the optimization, :math:`U_\\mathrm{target}`,
        as a 2D array of shape ``(D, D)``.
        You must provide exactly one of `target_state` or `target_operation`.
    sample_count : int, optional
        The number of times between 0 and `gate_duration` (included)
        at which the evolution is sampled.
        Defaults to 128.
    cutoff_frequency : float or None, optional
        The cutoff frequency of a linear sinc filter to be applied to the piecewise-constant
        signals you provide for the coefficients. If not provided, the signals are not filtered.
        If the signals are filtered, a larger sample count leads to a more accurate numerical
        integration. If the signals are not filtered, the sample count has no effect on the
        numerical precision of the integration.
    **optimization_kwargs : dict
        Additional parameters to pass to boulderopal.run_optimization.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The result of the `run_optimization` call.
        Its ``output`` item is a dictionary containing the optimized coefficients and information
        about the time evolution of the system, with the following keys:

            optimized coefficients
                These are the names of the requested optimized Hamiltonian coefficients, under
                keys such as ``[transmon_1_name].drive``, ``[cavity_2_name].frequency``,
                ``[transmon_2_name]_[cavity_1_name]_interaction.dispersive_shift``, and
                ``[cavity_1_name]_[cavity_2_name]_interaction.cross_kerr_coefficient`` (where
                ``[transmon_n_name]`` and  ``[cavity_n_name]`` are the names assigned to the
                respective transmons or cavities).
                If you pass a `cutoff_frequency`, the filtered versions of the
                piecewise-constant coefficients are also included with keys such as
                ``[transmon_2_name].drive_filtered``.
            ``infidelity``
                The state/operational infidelity of the optimized evolution.
            ``sample_times``
                The times at which the system's evolution is sampled,
                as an array of shape ``(T,)``.
            ``unitaries``
                The system's unitary time-evolution operators at each sample time,
                as an array of shape ``(T, D, D)``.
            ``state_evolution``
                The time evolution of the initial state at each sample time,
                as an array of shape ``(T, D)``.
                This is only returned if you provide an initial state.

    Notes
    -----
    The Hamiltonian of the system is of the form

    .. math::
        H = \\sum_i H_{\\mathrm{transmon}_i}
            + \\sum_i H_{\\mathrm{cavity}_i}
            + \\sum_{i,j} H_{\\mathrm{transmon}_i-\\mathrm{transmon}_j}
            + \\sum_{i,j} H_{\\mathrm{transmon}_i-\\mathrm{cavity}_j}
            + \\sum_{i,j} H_{\\mathrm{cavity}_i-\\mathrm{cavity}_j}

    where i and j mark the i-th and j-th transmon or cavity.
    For their definition of each Hamiltonian term, see its respective class.

    The Hilbert space of the system is defined as the outer product of all the
    transmon Hilbert spaces (in the order they're provided in `transmons`) with
    the cavity Hilbert spaces (in the order they're provided in `cavities`), that is:

    .. math::
        \\mathcal{H} =
            \\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{transmon}_1} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{transmon}_2}
            \\otimes \\ldots
            \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{cavity}_1} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{cavity}_2}
            \\otimes \\ldots

    The system dimension `D` is then the product of all transmon and cavity dimensions.

    If you provide an `initial_state` and a `target_state`, the optimization cost is defined as the
    infidelity of the state transfer process,

    .. math::
        \\mathcal{I}
            = 1 - \\left|
                \\langle
                    \\Psi_\\mathrm{target} | U(t_\\mathrm{gate}) | \\Psi_\\mathrm{initial}
                \\rangle
            \\right|^2 ,

    where :math:`U(t)` is the unitary time-evolution operator generated by the Hamiltonian.

    If you provide a `target_operation`, the optimization cost is defined as the operational
    infidelity,

    .. math::
        \\mathcal{I}
            = 1 - \\left| \\frac
                {\\mathrm{Tr} (U_\\mathrm{target}^\\dagger U(t_\\mathrm{gate}))}
                {\\mathrm{Tr} (U_\\mathrm{target}^\\dagger U_\\mathrm{target})}
            \\right|^2 .

    <https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/references/boulder-opal/
    boulderopal/superconducting.html>`_
    for a list of the relevant objects to describe subsystems and optimizable coefficients.
