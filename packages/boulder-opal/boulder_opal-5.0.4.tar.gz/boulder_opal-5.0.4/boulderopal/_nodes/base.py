    name: Optional[str] = None,
) -> Operation:
    """
    Return a graph operation.

    This is a helper function for easily creating an Operation inside a graph method. `obj` is
    expected to be the graph method itself and kwargs is expected to be `locals()`. For example,
    inside a sub-graph method `node_func`, one might call
    `create_operation(self.node_func, locals())` to create an operator instead of repeating all
    the arguments that node_func takes.

    The optional graph and name parameter allows one to pass the graph object and an operation name
    explicitly when necessary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : Callable
        A graph method.
    kwargs : dict
        The keyword arguments for the operation.
        These are usually the local variable inside the graph method.
    graph : Graph or None, optional
        The graph object can be derived from the `__self__` attribute of the method.
        But in the case where `__self__` might not be the actual graph object,
        one can pass it explicitly.
    name : str or None, optional
        Often the operation name is the same as the method name. If not, one can overwrite it using
        this parameter. For example, nodes in the random namespace.

    Returns
    -------
    Operation
        The newly created operation.
