.. py:class:: HEROPeer(realm: str = 'heros', session_manager=None)

   A HEROPeer provides the minimal interface to establish the HERO communication on top of the zenoh backend.
   To this end, it provides methods to send cbor-serialized messages via the zenoh network. It establishes
   the `@object` namespace and communicates in a defined realm. Methods to discover objects in the realm and
   to retrieve their object information are provided.

   :param realm: Name of the realm that this HEROPeer belongs to. (default: heros)
   :param session: optional zenoh session to use. If none is provided, a new zenoh session will be started

      :value: []



   .. py:method:: _query_selector(*args, **kwargs) -> list

      Send a query to an endpoint and deserialize the results. This is a low-level function.

      :param selector: The zenoh selector.
      :param target: zenoh target for the query
      :param timeout: timeout for the zenoh get command

      :returns: list of deserialized results
      :rtype: list



   .. py:method:: _subscribe_selector(selector: str, callback: collections.abc.Callable, *args, **kwargs)

      Subscribe to a zenoh selector and a attach a callback.
      The callback receives the deserialized payload of the messages published.

      :param selector: zenoh selector for the subscription. See the zenoh documentation for valid descriptors.
      :param callback: method to be called for messages that match the selector. The method needs to accept one argument
                       which is the deserialized payload of the message.



   .. py:method:: _declare_queryable(selector: str, callback: collections.abc.Callable)


   .. py:method:: _get_object_info(object_name: str, timeout: float = 2.0) -> dict

      Retrieve the object information for a HERO in the current realm and with the given name.

      :param object_name: name of the HERO to get the object info for. This name is inserted into a zenoh key expression
                          and can thus contain the corresponding wildcards.
      :param timeout: timeout for the discover operation in seconds (default: 2)

      :returns: {remote_object_descriptor}}
      :rtype: dict of the form {name

      :value: '@object/heros/Uninferable'



   .. py:attribute:: _endpoints


   .. py:method:: _query_endpoint(endpoint: str, *args, **kwargs) -> list

      Send a query to an endpoint.
      This is a wrapper for _query_selector that enforces to talk to the endpoint of the remote object.

      :param endpoint: endpoint within this HERO. If the given endpoint does not start with the endpoint base path,
                       the endpoint base path is prepended to generate a zenoh selector.



   .. py:method:: _subscribe_endpoint(endpoint: str, callback: collections.abc.Callable, *args, **kwargs)

      Subscribe to an endpoint of this HERO.
      This is a wrapper for _subscribe_selector that enforces to talk to the endpoint of the remote object.

      :param endpoint: endpoint within this HERO. If the given endpoint does not start with the endpoint base path,
                       the endpoint base path is prepended to generate a zenoh selector.
      :param callback: method to be called for messages that match the selector. The method needs to accept one
                       argument which is the deserialized payload of the message.



.. py:class:: RemoteHERO(name: str, realm: str = 'heros', *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`HERO`


   Creates a local stub object from a remote HERO such that it seems like the remote object is a local object.
   The remote HERO is identified by its name and has to be available at the given realm.

   Attribute and method capabilities of the remote object are directly mapped to attributes and methods of the
   stub object, respectively. The signature of the methods is adapted accordingly. The remote attributes do not
   exist locally but are directly changed and read on the remote end. Event capabilities of the remote object
   are mapped to `RemoteEvent` objects that are members of this class. By connecting one or more callbacks to this
   event, the RemoteHERO can react on events triggered at the remote site.

   To be able to attach attributes to this class, every instance of a `RemoteHERO` is created from a dynamically
   generated child class of `RemoteHERO` with the name `RemoteHERO_<realm>_<HERO name>`.

   .. note:: To discover which objects are available in a certain realm, see :class:HEROObserver.

   :param name: name/identifier of the remote object
   :param realm: realm (think namespace) at which the object is registered. default is "heros"


   .. py:attribute:: _hero_tags


   .. py:attribute:: _hero_implements


   .. py:attribute:: _remote_capabilities


   .. py:attribute:: _liveliness_subscription


   .. py:method:: _liveliness_changed(sample)


   .. py:method:: _get_capabilities()

      Obtain capabilities from remote object.

      :returns: List of capabilities of the remote device
      :rtype: list[Capability]



   .. py:method:: _setattr_remote_capabilities()

      Attach functions to the instance that reflect the name and signature of the capabilities of
      the remote object.

   .. py:method:: _destroy_hero()


   .. py:method:: __hash__()


.. py:class:: LocalHERO(name: str, *args, realm: str = 'heros', implements: list[str] | None = None, tags: list[str] | None = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`HERO`


   Base class for objects exposed through HEROS.
   Any object that should be able to be accessed remotely must be based off this class.

   :param name: name/identifier under which the object is available. Make sure this name is unique in the realm.
   :param realm: realm the HERO should exist in. default is "heros"
   :param implements: list of interfaces that are implemented by the hero
   :param tags: list of tags to identify and classify the hero


   .. py:attribute:: liveliness_token


   .. py:method:: _capabilities()

      Analyze ourself (i.e. the current object) and automatically generate the capabilities of the HERO from this.

      For every method that doesn't start with _ a method capability is announced. Every defined class attribute
      becomes an attribute capability. Every method that is defined in the class with the @event decorator becomes
      an event.

      While scanning for the capabilities, this method directly creates the necessary callbacks and defines the zenoh
      queryables for the capabilities.



   .. py:method:: _destroy_hero()


   .. py:method:: _connect_local_hero_callback(event: collections.abc.Callable, remote_hero_method: collections.abc.Callable, origin: str = None) -> str

      Connect a method of `RemoteHERO` as a callback to an event of the `LocalHERO`.
      This leads to a new, direct P2P connection between the `RemoteHERO` and the `LocalHERO` to call the method.

      :param event: the event `callable`, i.e. a method that is decorated with `@event` in the `LocalHERO`.
      :param remote_hero_method: `callable` to connect as a callback.
      :param origin: optional `str` indicating the semantic origin of the connection.

      :returns: name of the callback.
      :rtype: str



   .. py:method:: _disconnect_local_hero_callback(event: collections.abc.Callable, remote_hero_method: collections.abc.Callable) -> bool

      Disconnect a method of `RemoteHERO` from an event of the `LocalHERO`.

      :param event: the event `callable`, i.e. a method that is decorated with `@event` in the `LocalHERO`.
      :param remote_hero_method: `callable` to connect as a callback.

      :returns: truth value if the remote method was indeed a callback.
      :rtype: bool



   .. py:method:: _get_local_hero_callbacks(event: collections.abc.Callable) -> list

      Get a list of dictionary representations of the callbacks of an event of the `LocalHERO`.

      :param event: the event `callable`, i.e. a method that is decorated with `@event` in the `LocalHERO`.

      :returns: dictionary representations of the callbacks.
      :rtype: list



.. py:class:: EventObserver(object_selector: str, event_name: str, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`HEROPeer`


   A class that can observe and handle the data emitted by one or more HEROs from a defined event name.
   In particular, this class provides an efficient way to listen to the data emitted by multiple HEROs in
   the realm. By not instantiating the HEROs themselves but just subscribing to the topics for the event, this
   reduces the pressure on the backing zenoh network. If, however, only the data of a few HEROs should be observed,
   it might make more sense to just instantiate the according RemoteHEROs and connect a callback to their events.

   :param object_selector: Selector to specify which objects to observe. This becomes part of a zenoh selector and thus
   :param can be anything that makes sense in the selector. Use :code:`*` to observe all HEROs in the realm.:
   :param event_name: Name of the event to observe.


   .. py:attribute:: _object_selector


   .. py:attribute:: _event_name


   .. py:attribute:: _event_callbacks


   .. py:attribute:: _subscription


   .. py:method:: _handle_event(key_expr: str, data)


   .. py:method:: register_callback(func: collections.abc.Callable) -> str | bool

      Register a callback that should be called on events.

      :param func: Function to call.

      :returns: The uuid of the callback or False if the callback was already present.



   .. py:method:: remove_callback(func: collections.abc.Callable) -> bool

      Remove a callback.

      :param func: Function to remove.

      :returns: True if the callback could be removed, False otherwise.



   .. py:method:: remove_callback_uid(uid: str) -> bool

      Remove a callback by its uid.

      :param uid: Uid of the callback.

      :returns: True



.. py:class:: HEROObserver(*args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`HEROPeer`


   A HEROObserver keeps track of the HEROs in a given realm by monitoring its zenoh liveliness tokens.
   The member attribute ``known_objects`` always holds a list of all HEROs known to the observer.

   :param realm: Name of the realm that this HEROPeer belongs to. (default: heros)
   :param session: optional zenoh session to use. If none is provided, a new zenoh session will be started
