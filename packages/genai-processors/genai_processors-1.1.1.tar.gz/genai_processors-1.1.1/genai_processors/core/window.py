"""Windowing processors for working with long or realtime streams.

When dealing with long streams (e.g. video file) or doing contigous inference on
realtime streams one may need to slice them in-to prompts to be sent to an LLM.
This module contains utilities for that.

Also see genai_processors.core.realtime.LiveProcessor for bidirectional
"Live" chat implementation.

class RollingPrompt:
  """Rolling prompt (aka iterator of prompts) for conversation processors.

  NOTE: This is a low level utility. Prefer using realtime.LiveProcessor or
  window.Window which provide higher level abstractions.

  This class acts as a buffer and organizer for a continuous, "infinite" stream
  of multimodal parts (e.g. from a real-time camera feed). It transforms this
  stream into finite, time-segmented prompts suitable for turn-based models.

  Adding Parts:
    add_part(part): Immediately appends a multimodal part to the current prompt.
    stash_part(part): Temporarily stores a part to be appended later. This is
      useful when it's not the client's "turn" to send parts (e.g. while a
      model is generating a response) and you want to delay its inclusion in the
      active prompt.
    apply_stash(): Appends all currently stashed parts to the active prompt.

  Accessing prompts:
    pending() -> `AsyncIterable[ProcessorPart]`: Returns an asynchronous
      iterator representing the current prompt state. This iterator first yields
      the compressed conversation history, then *continues* to stream any new
      parts added via `add_part` or `apply_stash`. This streaming behavior
      allows models to begin processing the current turn *before it is fully
      completed*, significantly minimizing Time To First Token (TTFT).
   finalize_pending(): This method should be called when it is time for the
     underlying model to make the turn.
     * The `AsyncIterable` previously returned by `pending()` will cease
       yielding parts after all current parts have been delivered, signaling the
       model to generate its response.
     * The history compression is applied to accumulated conversation (which
       does not include the ongoing model response, as it has not arrived yet).
     * A new `pending` iterator is then implicitly created for the *next* turn.
     * The compressed history is written to this new iterator, and any parts
       added subsequently will be directed to this new turn's pendig prompt.

  Consider a scenario where a model is actively generating a response, but the
  real-time stream (e.g. a video feed) continues to produce new parts (e.g.
  image frames). Directly using `add_part` for these new frames would
  incorrectly place them *within* or before the ongoing model response, falsely
  suggesting the model considered these new images during its computation for
  the *current* response.

  To address this, such parts coming from the application should be added using
  `stash_part` and appended to the prompt after the model turn is completed
  using `apply_stash`.

  NOTE: You can put a processor before the Window which will mark Parts with
  `part.metadata['turn_complete'] = true` or filter-out unwanted parts. For
  example when detecting events in a video stream you may leave only image parts
  and mark each as turn_complete.

  The output of `window_processor` is propagated to the Window output, but
  unlike `LiveProcessor` it is not kept in the prompt of `window_processor` and
  is not visible to the consecutive `window_processor` invocations.

  Many instances of `window_processor` may be run concurrently, but their output
  will be yielded in order.

  After `window_processor` is invoked, the accumulated prompt is compressed with
  `compress_history`. E.g. one can keep the last N turns or last M seconds or
  use an LLM to summarize the context. Note that new Parts added after the last
  turn won't be compressed. This allows handling each window in a streaming
  fashion.

  NOTE: If more sophisticated compression is needed (e.g. you want to leave
  image frames with increasing backoff: now, -1s, -5s, -15s, -30s) this can be
  done on per-window basis inside of `window_processor`. Similarly one can use
  Preamble/Postamble processors or set a system prompt to inject additional
