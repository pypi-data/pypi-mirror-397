# flake8-tergeo

## About this project

flake8-tergeo is a flake8 plugin which adds many new rules to improve your code quality.
Out of the box it also brings a curated lists of other plugins without additional efforts needed.
In difference to other projects, the list of included plugins is rather small and actively maintained.

The included plugins and checks are opinionated, meaning that e.g. f-strings are preferred.
Therefore, checks to find other formatting methods are included but none, to find f-strings.

Also, code formatters like ``black`` and ``isort`` are recommended; therefore no code
formatting rules are included.

## Documentation

You can find the documentation [here](https://sap.github.io/flake8-tergeo/).

## Development
This project uses `uv`.
To setup a venv for development use
`python3.14 -m venv venv && pip install uv && uv sync --all-groups && rm -rf venv/`.
Then use `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate your venv.

## Release Actions
* Determine the new version by using the format `YY.M.D.C` with `YY` are the two last digits of the
  year, `M` is the current month (maybe two digits if needed), `D` is the current day (maybe two digits if needed)
  and `C` is a counter of the releases per day starting at 0
* Update the version in `pyproject.toml`
* Rename the section `Next version` in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) to the version released
  and create a new empty one
* Push a new tag like vX.X.X.X to trigger the release
