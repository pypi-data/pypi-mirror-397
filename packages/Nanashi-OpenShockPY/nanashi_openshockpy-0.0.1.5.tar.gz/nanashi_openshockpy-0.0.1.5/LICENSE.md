# Nameless Nanashi Code License (NNCL) v1.3-MODIFIED-OpenShockPY

**Copyright © 2025 [NamelessNanashi](<https://git.NamelessNanashi.dev/>)**

---

## 0. Purpose

This license lets people use, study, share, and modify the Work under firm ethical and non-commercial terms. Any adaptation or networked use must carry forward this exact license and policy requirements. This license includes a limited exception (Section 6A) allowing the Work to be included as a distinct component in open source projects using different licenses, provided the Work itself retains this license and all its protections.

---

## 1. Definitions

- **Work**: The copyrighted material licensed under this document, including source, binaries, media, and documentation.
- **You / Your**: The individual or legal entity exercising permissions under this license.
- **Adaptation**: Any modification, derivative, translation, aggregation with, or inclusion of the Work into another work, including as a library or component.
- **Share**: To provide the Work or Adaptations to any third party, by any means, including download, hosting, software-as-a-service (SaaS), APIs, containers, or device preinstallation.
- **Non-Commercial**: Not primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation of any kind. This includes (without limitation) direct sales, subscriptions, SaaS fees, paid support, training, consulting, advertising, sponsorship, affiliate links, data monetization, bundling tied to a paid product/service, and any internal deployment primarily supporting revenue-generating activity.
- **Non-Rewarded Donation**: A voluntary monetary contribution that provides **no goods, services, access, features, priority, advertising, sponsorship, acknowledgments of a promotional nature, or any other consideration** to the donor. Neutral, non-promotional listing of donor names (without logos, non-profile links, or prominence) is not a “reward.”
- **Policy**: The ethical standards and prohibitions in Section 4 and the attribution/notice duties in Section 3.

---

## 2. Grant

Subject to Your compliance with this license, the Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to use, run, study, reproduce, and make Adaptations of the Work, and to Share the Work and Adaptations, **solely for Non-Commercial purposes**.

---

## 3. Conditions (Attribution & Notices)

When You Share the Work or any Adaptation, You must:

1. **Attribution**: Give appropriate credit to the Licensor, include the project name, and provide a copy of this license (or a clickable link if the medium allows).
2. **Change Notice**: State the changes You made and the date of those changes.
3. **Source Availability**: If You Share an Adaptation in executable or compiled form, You must **concurrently** make the complete corresponding source available under this license, including build instructions and any “installation information” needed to install and run the modified software on user devices (if applicable).
4. **Policy Propagation**: You must reproduce **this exact license text** (including Section 4 Policy) in full with the Work and any Adaptation. You may not substitute or add terms that weaken, bypass, or conflict with this license.

---

## 4. Policy (Ethical Standards & Prohibitions)

The Work must **not** be used to promote or enable bigotry, discrimination, or the violation of human rights. Specifically including but not limited to:

- No use for racism, xenophobia, queerphobia, transphobia, homophobia, enbyphobia, misogyny, misandry, and/or sexism.
- No use to inflict or facilitate violence, repression, or human-rights abuses as defined by widely recognized frameworks (e.g., the UDHR and ECHR) and relevant court rulings.
- No use by law-enforcement, carceral, immigration-enforcement, military, or military-contractor entities, nor by individuals acting on their behalf.

You must not remove or alter this Policy when Sharing the Work or Adaptations. Any terms You add (e.g., a contributor license agreement or company policy) must be **stricter or equal**, never looser, than this Policy.

---

## 5. Non-Commercial Use Only

All uses must be Non-Commercial. The following are **not** allowed without a separate commercial license from the Licensor:

- Selling the Work or Adaptations; charging for access (including SaaS/APIs); monetized hosting; ad-supported distribution; paywalled documentation; paid training, support, or consulting centered on the Work; bundling in paid products or services; internal deployments primarily supporting revenue generation.
- Using the Work to train or fine-tune any machine-learning or AI model for commercial use or deployment, or including the Work in datasets intended for any monetized or commercial ML/AI activity.

You may charge **actual, verifiable cost of physical media and postage only**, with no markup or indirect monetization.

---

## 6. Strong Share-Alike (Same License)

Any Adaptation You Share must be licensed **only** under this **NNCL v1.3-MODIFIED-OpenShockPY** (or later) license, in full, with the Policy intact. No other license (including dual-licensing by You) may be applied to the Adaptation You Share, and You may not add field-of-use, patent, or other restrictions conflicting with this license.

**Network use (including providing functionality via network, SaaS, or API) constitutes Sharing** for the purpose of this section and triggers all obligations above (Attribution, Source, Policy, and Same-License).

### 6A. Exception for Open Source Project Integration

Notwithstanding Section 6, You may include the Work (unmodified or as an Adaptation) as a component, library, or dependency within a larger open source project that uses a different open source license, provided that:

1. **Preserved License**: The Work and any direct Adaptations of it remain licensed exclusively under this **NNCL v1.3-MODIFIED-OpenShockPY** license, clearly identified with this complete license text.
2. **Separate Identity**: The Work is maintained as a distinct, separately-identifiable component (e.g., as a library, module, package, or clearly-documented dependency) and is not bundled or merged directly into the larger project's codebase in a way that makes attribution or license identification impracticable.
3. **Clear Notice**: The larger project's documentation (README, NOTICE, or similar) clearly states that the Work is included, identifies it by name, attributes the Licensor, and links to or includes this license.
4. **Compliance**: All other terms of this license (Sections 2-5, 7-14) remain in full effect for the Work component, including the Non-Commercial requirement, the Policy (Section 4), and attribution obligations.
5. **No Weakening**: The larger project's license must not attempt to override, weaken, or contradict the terms of this license as applied to the Work component.

This exception does **not** permit:

- Removing or altering this license from the Work;
- Relicensing the Work itself under a different license;
- Using the Work in a commercial context (Section 5 still applies); or
- Violating the Ethics Policy (Section 4).

---

## 7. Patent Peace

If You or Your affiliate initiates or maintains a patent suit alleging that the Work or an Adaptation infringes a patent, Your license under this NNCL automatically terminates as of the date the suit is filed.

---

## 8. No Endorsement; No Trademark

This license does not grant permission to use the Licensor’s name, logos, or trademarks. Do not imply endorsement or affiliation.

---

## 9. Compliance, Cure & Termination

- **Notice & Cure**: If the Licensor notifies You of a violation, Your license will continue only if You cure the violation within **30 days** of the notice.
- **Automatic Termination**: Failure to cure within 30 days results in immediate termination.
- **No Retroactive Permission**: Termination ends all rights granted by this license. Continued use after termination infringes the Licensor’s rights.
- **Reinstatement**: The Licensor may reinstate the license in writing at their sole discretion.

---

## 10. Distribution for Large-Scale or Organizational Use

If You Share the Work or an Adaptation to more than 100 users (internal or external) or deploy it across an organization, You must document (in a publicly accessible place linked from the project README):

- How to obtain source, build, and install the version actually deployed;
- Your compliance with Section 4 Policy; and
- A contact method for receiving compliance notices.

---

## 11. Warranty Disclaimer

THE WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USING, MODIFYING, OR SHARING THE WORK.

---

## 12. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR THIS LICENSE.

---

## 13. Severability; No Waiver

If any provision of this license is unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect. The Licensor’s failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of the right to do so later.

---

## 14. Entire License; Updates

This is the entire agreement regarding the Work. The Licensor may publish new versions of the NNCL. Each version of the Work remains licensed under the specific NNCL version stated or included at the time of its release. Updates to the NNCL do not retroactively alter the license of previously released versions of the Work. The Licensor may choose to apply a newer NNCL version to subsequent releases of the Work by explicitly doing so in the source code, documentation, or accompanying license file.
