**GeomFuM** is a Modular Python Package for Machine Learning with `Functional Maps <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2185520.2185526>`_. 
Have a look at our `Software Paper Preprint <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zr7ml2QWEOOlS9S3imER_HBuvYwMm3oo/view?usp=sharing>`_.

Installation
------------
We have a pipl package that you can install with the following command from your terminal
::
    
    pip install geomfum

Or directly from the GitHub repository
::
    
    pip install geomfum@git+https://github.com/3diglab/geomfum.git@main

Or

::
    
    pip install geomfum 
    pip install geomstats@git+https://github.com/geomstats/geomstats.git@main


Or the classic pipeline: ``clone + pip install``.

Make sure you have installed the most recent version of Geomstats to correctly handle the backend.

::
    pip install geomstats@git+https://github.com/geomstats/geomstats.git@main


⚠️ **ISSUES**



- Installation issues may arise from dependencies relying on C++ (particularly `robust_laplacian <https://pypi.org/project/robust-laplacian/>`_).

- Make sure all their requirements are installed.

Some functionality requires packages that are not published on PyPI and must be installed manually:

- `Rematching`: 

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/filthynobleman/rematching.git@python-binding


- `Polpo`: 

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/geometric-intelligence/polpo.git@main


How to use
----------

The `how-to notebooks <./notebooks/how_to>`_ are designed to safely let you dive in the package.

Why not starting from the `beginning <./notebooks/how_to/load_mesh_from_file.ipynb>`_ and simply follow the links that inspire you the most?

Choose the backend
------------------

GeomFuM can run seamlessly with ``numpy`` and ``pytorch``. 
By default, the ``numpy`` backend is used. The visualizations are only available with this backend.

The backend is based on the `Geomstats <https://github.com/geomstats/geomstats>`_ backend, which is installed automatically. The GeomFuM backend add functionality, especially regarding sparse matrices and device handling.

You can choose your backend by setting the environment variable
``GEOMSTATS_BACKEND`` to ``numpy``, or ``pytorch``, and
importing the backend module. From the command line:

::

    export GEOMSTATS_BACKEND=<backend_name>

and in the Python3 code:

::

    import gsops.backend as gs
