# color-spreadsheet

Apply color coding to Excel spreadsheet cells based on content type.

## Overview

`color-spreadsheet` is a Python package that automatically color-codes cells in Excel spreadsheets based on their content type. This makes it easier to visually distinguish between hardcoded inputs, formulas, and cross-sheet references.

## Installation

```bash
pip install color-spreadsheet
```

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
color-spreadsheet --input="input.xlsx" --output="output.xlsx"
```

### Full Options

```bash
color-spreadsheet --input="input.xlsx" --output="output.xlsx" --colorway="standard-financial"
```

### List Available Colorways

```bash
color-spreadsheet --list-colorways
```

### Python API

```python
from color_spreadsheet import process_workbook
from color_spreadsheet.colorways.registry import get_colorway

# Get the colorway
colorway = get_colorway("standard-financial")

# Process the workbook
stats = process_workbook("input.xlsx", "output.xlsx", colorway)

# Print statistics
print(f"Processed {stats.total_cells_processed} cells")
```

## Color Scheme

The default `standard-financial` colorway uses the following color scheme:

- **Blue** (0000FF): Hardcoded values (numbers, dates, booleans) - These are your inputs
- **Black** (000000): Formulas referencing cells in the same sheet
- **Green** (008000): Formulas referencing cells in other sheets (cross-sheet references)
- **Unchanged**: Text labels (left as default formatting)

This color scheme makes it easy to:
- Identify which cells contain hardcoded data that may need updating
- Trace formula dependencies within and across sheets
- Distinguish between data inputs and calculated values

## Extensibility

The package is designed with an extensible colorway architecture. Future versions will support additional colorways, and you can create custom colorways by extending the `Colorway` base class.
