# PDS Lasso Issues

The PDS Lasso Issues package provides utilities handle issues on GitHub. It provides four commands:

- `milestones`
- `pds-issues`
- `move-issues`
- `pds-labels`
- `add-version-label-to-open-bugs`

Please visit our website at: https://nasa-pds.github.io/lasso-issues

It may have useful information for developers and end-users.


## Prerequisites

Installing this software requires `git` to be present on the target systme.


## User Quickstart

Install with:

    pip install lasso-issues


To execute, run:

    (put your run commands here)


## Code of Conduct

All users and developers of the NASA-PDS software are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read this to ensure you understand the expectations of our community.


## Development

To develop this project, use your favorite text editor, or an integrated development environment with Python support, such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).


### Contributing

For information on how to contribute to NASA-PDS codebases please take a look at our [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).


### Installation

Install in editable mode and with extra developer dependencies into your virtual environment of choice:

    pip install --editable '.[dev]'

Configure the `pre-commit` hooks:

    pre-commit install
    pre-commit install -t pre-push
    pre-commit install -t prepare-commit-msg
    pre-commit install -t commit-msg

These hooks check code formatting and also aborts commits that contain secrets such as passwords or API keys. However, a one time setup is required in your global Git configuration. See [the wiki entry on Git Secrets](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/nasa-pds.github.io/wiki/Git-and-Github-Guide#git-secrets) to learn how.


### Packaging

To isolate and be able to re-produce the environment for this package, you should use a [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). To do so, run:

    python3 -m venv venv

Then exclusively use `venv/bin/python`, `venv/bin/pip`, etc. Or, "activate" the virtual environment by sourcing the appropriate script in the `venv/bin` directory.

If you have `tox` installed and would like it to create your environment and install dependencies for you run:

    tox --devenv <name you'd like for env> -e dev

Dependencies for development are specified as the `dev` `extras_require` in `setup.cfg`; they are installed into the virtual environment as follows:

    pip install --editable '.[dev]'

All the source code is in a sub-directory under `src`.


### Tooling

The `dev` `extras_require` included in the template repo installs `black`, `flake8` (plus some plugins), and `mypy` along with default configuration for all of them. You can run all of these (and more!) with:

    tox -e lint
