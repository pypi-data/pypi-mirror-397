The Python package **pco** is a powerful and easy to use high level Software Development Kit (SDK)
for working with PCO cameras. It contains everything needed for camera setup, image acquistion,
readout and color conversion.

**Now also including a class to control Excelitas XCite light sources**

The high-level class architecture makes it very easy to integrate PCO cameras and XCite light sources into your own
software, while still having access to the underlying pco.sdk and pco.recorder interface for a
detailed control of all possible functionalities of the camera.

- **Documentation**: Please visit `pco.python <https://www.excelitas.com/de/product/pco-software-development-kits#custom-tab-python>`_ and open the `Documentation` tab
- **Website**: https://www.excelitas.com/product-category/pco
- **Support**: support.pco@excelitas.com
- **Examples**: Please visit `Github-Samples <https://github.com/Excelitas-PCO/pco.python-samples>`_

Installation
============
Install from pypi (recommended)::

    $ pip install pco


For cameras with USB interface on linux you will need to add usb rules to the system.
This can be done with executing the following command (**sudo** permissions required):

.. code-block:: bash
  
    [ ! -f "/etc/udev/rules.d/pco_usb.rules" ] && sudo mkdir -p "/etc/udev/rules.d" && echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb" , ATTR{idVendor}=="1cb2" , GROUP="video" , MODE="0666" , SYMLINK+="pco_usb_camera%n"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/pco_usb.rules > /dev/null && udevadm trigger || true

To use the **XCite** class for controlling the Excelitas XCite light sources, on linux you need to make sure to have access to the serial ports, i.e. that the current user is in the group **dialout**.
This can be done with executing the following command (**sudo** permissions required):

.. code-block:: bash
  
    sudo adduser $USER dialout


Basic Usage
===========
.. code-block:: python

    import pco
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    with pco.Camera() as cam:

        cam.record(mode="sequence")
        image, meta = cam.image()

        plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray')
        plt.show()


Recorder Modes
==============
Depending on your workflow you can choose between different recording modes. 

Some modes are blocking, i.e. the ``record()`` function waits until recording is finished, some are non-blocking.
Some of them are storing the images in memory, the others directly as file(s) on the disk.
However, for the recorder modes which store the images as files,
accessing the recorded images is identical with the modes which store the images in memory.

.. list-table:: record modes
  :widths: 20 10 10 60
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Mode
    - Storage
    - Blocking
    - Description
  
  * - ``sequence``
    - Memory
    - yes
    - Record a sequence of images.
  
  * - ``sequence non blocking``
    - Memory
    - no 
    - Record a sequence of images, do not wait until record is finished.
  
  * - ``ring buffer``
    - Memory
    - no 
    - Continuously record images in a ringbuffer, once the buffer is full, old images are overwritten.
  
  * - ``fifo``
    - Memory
    - no 
    - Record images in fifo mode, i.e. you will always read images sequentially and once the buffer is full, recording will pause until older images have been read.
  
  * - ``tif``
    - File  
    - no 
    - Record images directly as tif files.
  
  * - ``multitif``
    - File  
    - no 
    - Record images directly as one or more multitiff file(s).
  
  * - ``pcoraw``
    - File  
    - no 
    - Record images directly as one pcoraw file.
  
  * - ``dicom``
    - File  
    - no 
    - Record images directly as dicom files.
  
  * - ``multidicom``
    - File  
    - no 
    - Record images directly as one or more multi-dicom file(s).
  
  * - ``camram segment``
    - Ram
    - no
    - Record images and stop if cam ram segment is full
  
  * - ``camram ring``
    - Ram
    - no
    - Record images and use cam ram segment as ring buffer

Image Formats
=============
All image data is always transferred as 2D or 3D numpy array.
Besides the standard 16 bit raw image data you also have the possibility to get your images in different formats,
shown in the table below.

The format is selected when calling the ``image()`` / ``images()`` / ``image_average()`` functions of the Camera class. 
The image data is stored as numpy array, which enables you to work with it in the most pythonic way.

  * - Format
    - Description
  
  * - ``Mono8,mono8``
    - Get image as 8 bit grayscale data.
  
  * - ``Mono16,mono16,raw16,bw16``
    - Get image as 16 bit grayscale/raw data.
  
  * - ``BGR8,bgr``
    - Get image as 24 bit color data in bgr format.
