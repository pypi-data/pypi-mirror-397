## Battery pack data

Data for battery packs will no longer be available in this library

## Adding fields

To add new fields, you can use the `bluetti-detect` command to first find out which version of iot protocol is used and if it uses encryption.

After you got this information, you can use the `bluetti-readall` command to read every registry and save the data to a json file. You should also note all values you see in the app to later compare the data.

Here's how to use the `bluetti-readall` command:

```bash
usage: bluetti-readall [-h] [-m MAC] [-v VERSION] [-e ENCRYPTION]

Detect bluetti devices

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MAC, --mac MAC     Mac-address of the powerstation
  -v VERSION, --version VERSION
                        IoT protocol version
  -e ENCRYPTION, --encryption ENCRYPTION
                        Add this if encryption is needed
```

With the separate tool at [bluetti-bt-raw-reader](https://github.com/Patrick762/bluetti-bt-raw-reader) you can view those values in a more understandable way.
