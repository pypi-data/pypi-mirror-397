# httpstatusx 🚦

**httpstatusx** is a semantic, bidirectional, and framework-agnostic Python library for working with HTTP status codes.

It removes the need to memorize numeric HTTP codes and helps backend developers write clean, readable, and maintainable APIs.

## ✨ Features

- Full IANA HTTP status code coverage
- Name → Code and Code → Name lookup
- Semantic categories (success, client_error, server_error, etc.)

- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Fully tested & open-source
