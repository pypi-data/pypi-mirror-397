    Run grid characterization.

    Characterize a vector grid based on specified raster and vector datasets.
    Outputs a new GeoPackage containing the input grid with added attributes for the
    user-specified characterizations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_dir : str
        Path to parent directory containing all geospatial raster and vector datasets
        to be used for grid characterization.
    grid : str
        Path to gridded vector dataset for which characterization will be performed.
        Must be an existing vector polygon dataset in a format that can be opened by
        pyogrio. Does not strictly need to be a grid, but some functionality may
        not work if it is not.
    characterizations : dict
        Characterizations to be performed. Must be a dictionary keyed by the name of
        the output attribute for each characterization. Each value must be another
        dictionary with the following keys:

        -   ``dset``: String indicating relative path within ``data_dir`` to dataset to
            be characterized.

        -   ``method``: String indicating characterization method to be performed.
            Refer to :obj:`reVeal.config.characterize.VALID_CHARACTERIZATION_METHODS`.

        -   ``attribute``: Attribute to summarize. Only required for certain methods.
            Default is ``None``/``null``.

        -   ``weights_dset``: String indicating relative path within data_dir to
            dataset to be used as weights. Only applies to characterization methods for
            rasters; ignored otherwise.

        -   ``neighbor_order``: Integer indicating the order of neighbors to include in
            the characterization of each grid cell. For example, ``neighbor_order = 1``
            would result in included first-order queen's case neighbors. Optional,
            default is ``0``, which does not include neighbors.

        -   ``buffer_distance``: Float indicating buffer distance to apply in the
            characterization of each grid cell. Units are based on the CRS of the input
            grid dataset. For instance, a value of 500 in CRS EPGS:5070 would apply a
            buffer of 500m to each grid cell before characterization. Optional, default
            is ``0``, which does not apply a buffer.

        -   ``parallel``: Boolean indicating whether to run the characterization in
            parallel. This method is only applicable to methods specified as
            ``supports_parallel`` in
            :obj:`reVeal.config.VALID_CHARACTERIZATION_METHODS`. Default is ``True``,
            which will run applicable method in parallel and have no effect for other
            methods. This value should only be changed to ``False`` for small input
            grids, where the performance overhead of setting up parallel processing
            will outweigh the speedup of running operations in parallel. As a general
            rule of thumb, as long as the number of grid cells in your grid is an order
            of magnitude larger than the number of cores available, using
            ``parallel=True`` should yield improved performance.

        -   ``max_workers``: Integer indicating the number of workers to use for
            parallel processing. Will only be applied to methods that support
            parallel processing. This input will take precedence over the top-level
            ``max_workers`` from the ``execution_control`` block  (if any). If
            neither are specified, all available workers will be used for parallel
            processing.

    expressions : dict
        Additional expressions to be calculated. Must be a dictionary by the name
        of the output attribute for each expression. Each value must be a string
        indicating the expression to be calculated. Expression strings can reference
        one or more attributes/keys referenced in the characterizations dictionary.
    out_dir : str
        Output parent directory. Results will be saved to a file named "grid_char.gpkg".
    max_workers : [int, NoneType], optional
        Maximum number of workers to use for multiprocessing when running applicable
        methods in parallel. By default None, will use all available workers for
        applicable methods. Note that this value will only be applied to
        characterizations where ``max_workers`` is not specified at the
        characterization-level configuration.
    _local : bool
        Flag indicating whether the code is being run locally or via HPC job
        submissions. NOTE: This is not a user provided parameter - it is determined
        dynamically by based on whether config["execution_control"]["option"] == "local"
        (defaults to True if not specified).
