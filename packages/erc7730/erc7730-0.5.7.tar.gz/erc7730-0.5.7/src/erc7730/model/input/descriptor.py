Package implementing an object model for ERC-7730 input descriptors.

This model represents descriptors before resolution phase:
    - URLs have been not been fetched yet
    - Contract addresses have not been normalized to lowercase
    - References have not been inlined
    - Constants have not been inlined
    - Field definitions have not been inlined
    - Nested fields have been flattened where possible
    - Selectors have been converted to 4 bytes form
