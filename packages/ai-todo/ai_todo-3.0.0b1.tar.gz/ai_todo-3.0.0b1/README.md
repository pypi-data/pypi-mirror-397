# todo.ai

**Simple, zero-interaction TODO management for AI agents**

## AI Agent Installation: Copy-paste this to your agent:

```
Adopt todo.ai for task tracking. Install using:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fxstein/todo.ai/main/install.sh | sh

Then create a task "Implement user authentication" with subtasks:
- Design database schema
- Create API endpoints
- Add frontend components
- Write tests
```

## Why todo.ai?

AI agents often track tasks internally, but this creates a closed system that gets lost after time or restarts. `todo.ai` provides a **permanent, version-controlled record** that lives in your Git repository.

**Key benefits:**

- **Permanent record**: Tasks persist across sessions, restarts, and time
- **Version controlled**: Tracked in Git alongside your code changes
- **Interactive**: Add and insert new tasks even while an agent works on a long task list
- **Simple**: Plain Markdown format that's human-readable and editable
- **Standard compliant**: Works naturally with the GitHub `TODO.md` standard

Your task list becomes part of your project history, visible in pull requests, and never gets lost.

## For AI Agents

Run `./todo.ai --help` to see all available commands and usage examples. Everything you need to know is there.

---

## For Humans

With `todo.ai`, you simply tell your AI agent what you want in plain English. Your agent handles all the technical details automatically.

**Examples of what you can ask your agent:**

```
Create a task for implementing user authentication
```

```
Break down the authentication feature into subtasks
```

```
Mark task 1 as complete
```

```
Show me all incomplete tasks tagged with #bug
```

```
Create a task to convince the coffee machine to understand sarcasm
```

Your agent understands natural language requests and translates them to the appropriate `todo.ai` commands. All tasks are tracked in `TODO.md` in your repository.

---

## See It In Action

This repository uses `todo.ai` for its own development! Check out [`TODO.md`](./TODO.md) to see:
- **Real examples** of how tasks are structured with subtasks and tags
- **Current development status** of the tool itself
- **Live demonstration** of the task management workflow

The TODO.md file showcases features like:
- Task hierarchies with subtasks
- Tag-based organization (`#security`, `#feature`, `#bug`)
- Task relationships and dependencies
- Completion tracking and archiving
- Development roadmap and priorities

This is the same file structure and workflow you'll use in your own projects with `todo.ai`.

## Why not GitHub Issues?

Agents need a **fast, local, Markdown-native** way to manage tasks. GitHub Issues adds too much complexity and overhead—API calls, authentication, rate limits, and network latency slow down task management.

**Key differences:**

- **Speed**: `todo.ai` is instant and local—no API calls or network delays
- **Simplicity**: Plain Markdown that agents can parse and modify directly
- **Zero overhead**: No authentication, rate limits, or API complexity
- **Native workflow**: Works seamlessly with your Git workflow

**But you can still reference GitHub Issues and PRs:**

GitHub issue and PR numbers can be tagged onto tasks and subtasks for reference. For example:
- *"Create a task for fixing #123"*
- *"Add subtask 1.1: Address PR #456 feedback"*

This keeps `todo.ai` fast and simple while still maintaining links to your GitHub workflow.

---

## Zero Interaction Design

- ✅ No prompts or confirmations
- ✅ No configuration required
- ✅ Instant operations
- ✅ Git-friendly (TODO.md tracked in repo)
- ✅ Works automatically without user input

Perfect for AI agents - just works.

## Installation

### Stable Release (Recommended)

Install via uv (recommended) or pipx for standard CLI and MCP Server support:

```bash
# Using uv (recommended - faster, more reliable)
uv tool install ai-todo

# Alternative: pipx
pipx install ai-todo
```

This installs two commands:
- `todo-ai`: The CLI tool (replaces `./todo.ai`).
- `todo-ai-mcp`: The MCP Server for AI agents (Cursor).

**Documentation:**
- [Python Migration Guide](docs/user/PYTHON_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) - How to upgrade from v2.x (Shell).
- [MCP Setup Guide](docs/user/MCP_SETUP.md) - How to set up Cursor AI integration.

### Beta Testing (Help Us Test)

Want to try upcoming features before they're released? Install the latest beta:

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv tool install --prerelease=allow ai-todo

# Alternative: pipx
pipx install --pre ai-todo
```

Beta releases let you test new features and provide feedback before stable release. See [Release Channels](#release-channels) below for more information.

<details>
<summary>Alternative Installation Methods</summary>

**Using pip:**
```bash
pip install ai-todo              # Stable
pip install --pre ai-todo        # Beta
```

> **Recommendation:** Use `uv tool` or `pipx` for isolated installations that won't conflict with other Python packages.

</details>

### Development Version

Install from Git to get the latest unreleased code:

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai.git@main

# Alternative: pipx
pipx install git+https://github.com/fxstein/todo.ai.git@main
```

### Release Channels

- **Stable:** Fully tested, production-ready releases (recommended)
- **Beta:** Feature-complete pre-releases for testing (7+ days before stable for major releases)
- **Development:** Latest code from main branch (may have bugs)

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history and release notes.

### Legacy Shell Script (v2.x)

If you cannot use Python, the legacy shell script is still available:

**Smart Installer:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fxstein/todo.ai/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Manual Installation:**
**Zsh version** (recommended for macOS):
```bash
curl -o todo.ai https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fxstein/todo.ai/main/todo.ai && chmod +x todo.ai
```

**Bash version** (recommended for Linux, requires bash 4+):
```bash
curl -o todo.ai https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fxstein/todo.ai/main/todo.bash && chmod +x todo.ai
```

> **Note:** The bash version requires bash 4.0+ for associative arrays. macOS ships with bash 3.2, so use the zsh version on macOS or upgrade bash via homebrew.

### Update

**Python (v3.0+):**
```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv tool upgrade todo-ai

# Alternative: pipx
pipx upgrade todo-ai
```

**Legacy Shell:**
```bash
./todo.ai update
```

### Uninstall

**Python (v3.0+):**
```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv tool uninstall ai-todo

# Alternative: pipx
pipx uninstall ai-todo
```

**Legacy Shell:**
```bash
./todo.ai uninstall              # Remove script only
./todo.ai uninstall --all        # Remove script, data, and rules
```
