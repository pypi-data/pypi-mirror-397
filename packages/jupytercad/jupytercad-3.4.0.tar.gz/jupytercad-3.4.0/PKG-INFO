# JupyterCAD - A JupyterLab extension for collaborative 3D geometry modeling.

JupyterCAD is a JupyterLab extension for 3D geometry modeling with collaborative editing support. It is designed to allow multiple people to work on the same file at the same time, and to facilitate discussion and collaboration around the 3D shapes being created.

JupyterCAD has support for FreeCAD files, which makes it easy to import and export models from FreeCAD. It also has a range of features for creating and manipulating 3D shapes, including a variety of primitives, transformations, and Boolean operations.

## Requirements

- JupyterLab >= 4.0.0
- freecad (optional)

## Installation

You can install JupyterCAD using conda/mamba (this installs freecad automatically):

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge jupytercad
```

Or using pip:

```bash
pip install jupytercad
```

Once you have installed the extension, you should be able to open the CAD viewer in JupyterLab and create 3D shapes!

Additionally, you can install `jupytercad-freecad` and edit `.FCStd` files in JupyterLab.

## Deploying JupyterCAD with JupyterLite

You can run JupyterCAD entirely in the browser using **JupyterLite**.

1. **Create a repository** using the [xeus-lite-demo](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-lite-demo) template.
2. In your fork, edit `environment.yml` and add:
   ```yaml
   - jupytercad-lite
   ```
3. **Add your jcad and example files** under the `content/` directory of your repository.
   These files will be available directly inside your Lite deployment.
4. **Enable GitHub Pages** under _Settings → Pages_ for your repository.
5. Once the build completes, your Lite deployment will be live at:
   ```
   https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
   ```

This provides a lightweight, fully browser-based JupyterCAD environment — no server required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Collaboration is **not yet supported** in JupyterLite static deployments.
