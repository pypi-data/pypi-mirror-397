ZStar: A code for calculations of Born effective charge and dielectric responses.

ZStar provides a set of tools for computing Born effective charge, polarization
and phonon-related properties of materials from first-principles calculations. 
It is designed to simplify and automate data generation, analysis, and post-
processing for materials scientists and engineers.

Typical capabilities include:
- Pre- and post-processing workflows for polarization analyses.
- Phonon data generation and post-processing utilities.
- Structure analysis and symmetry consistency checks.
- Utilities for handling Wyckoff positions and irreducible representations.

The code is intended to interface with common first-principles and lattice
dynamics frameworks (e.g. ABACUS, Phonopy, PYATB), while keeping the
Python-side workflows as lightweight and scriptable as possible.
