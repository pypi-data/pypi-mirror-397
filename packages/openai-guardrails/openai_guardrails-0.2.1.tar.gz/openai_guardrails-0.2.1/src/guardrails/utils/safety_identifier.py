"""OpenAI safety identifier utilities.

This module provides utilities for handling the OpenAI safety_identifier parameter,
which is used to track guardrails library usage for monitoring and abuse detection.

The safety identifier is only supported by the official OpenAI API and should not
be sent to Azure OpenAI or other OpenAI-compatible providers.
