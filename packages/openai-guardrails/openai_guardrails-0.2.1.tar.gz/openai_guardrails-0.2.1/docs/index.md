# Guardrails

**Guardrails** is a safety framework for LLM applications that automatically validates inputs and outputs using configurable checks. Use the [Guardrails Wizard](https://guardrails.openai.com/) to create configurations, then drop in our client classes for automatic validation.

## Why Guardrails

- **Drop-in replacement** for OpenAI clients with automatic validation
- **No-code configuration** via the Guardrails Wizard
- **Pipeline-based** validation across input, output, and pre-flight stages
- **Production ready** for real-world LLM applications

## How It Works

1. **Configure**: Use the Wizard or define pipeline configurations
2. **Replace**: Use `GuardrailsAsyncOpenAI` instead of `AsyncOpenAI`
3. **Validate**: Guardrails run automatically on every API call
4. **Handle**: Access results via `response.guardrail_results`

## Built-in Guardrails

- **Content Safety**: Moderation, jailbreak detection
- **Data Protection**: PII detection, URL filtering  
- **Content Quality**: Hallucination detection, off topic prompts

## Quickstart

```python
from guardrails import GuardrailsAsyncOpenAI

client = GuardrailsAsyncOpenAI(config="guardrails_config.json")
response = await client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input="Hello"
)
# Guardrails run automatically
print(response.output_text)
```
