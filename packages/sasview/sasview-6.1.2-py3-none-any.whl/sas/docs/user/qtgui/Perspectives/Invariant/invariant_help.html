<h2>Principle<a class="headerlink" href="#principle" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>For any multi-phase system, i.e. any system that contains regions with
different scattering length densities (SLD), the integral over all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{q}\)</span>
of the appropriately dimensionally-weighted scattering cross-section (ie,
‘intensity’, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I(\vec{q})\)</span> in absolute units) is a <em>constant</em> directly
proportional to the mean-square average fluctuation in SLD and the phase
composition. Usefully, this value is <em>independent</em> of the sizes, shapes, or
interactions, or, more generally, the arrangement, of the phase
domains (i.e. it is <strong>invariant</strong>) <em>provided the system is incompressible</em>
(i.e, the relative volume fractions of the phases do not change). For the
purposes of this discussion, a phase is any portion of the material which
has a SLD that is distinctly different from the average SLD of the material.
This constant is known as the <em>Scattering Invariant</em>, the <em>Porod Invariant</em>,
or simply as the <em>Invariant</em>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q^*\)</span>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In this document we shall denote the invariant by the often encountered
symbol <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q^*\)</span>. But the reader should be aware that other symbols can be
encountered in the literature. Glatter &amp; Kratky<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#glatter-kratky" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, and
Stribeck<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#stribeck" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, for example,both use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span>, the same symbol we use to
denote the scattering vector in SasView(!), whilst
Melnichenko<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#melnichenko" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> uses <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z\)</span>. Other variations include <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_I\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>As the invariant is a fundamental law of scattering, it can be used for sanity
checks (for example, scattering patterns from the same sample that may look
very different <em>should</em> have the same invariant <em>if</em> the hypothesis of what
is going on in the sample is correct), to cross-calibrate different SAS
instruments, and, as explained below, can yield an independent estimate of
volume fractions or contrast terms.</p>

<h2>Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<section id="calculation">
<h3>Calculation<a class="headerlink" href="#calculation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Assuming isotropic scattering, acquired on a typical ‘pinhole geometry’
instrument, the invariant integral can be computed from the 1D reduced data
(assuming the reduced data has removed all background from sample
holders,incoherent scattering in the case of neutrons, etc.) as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q^* = \int_0^\infty q^2I(q)\,dq\]</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>SasView, and to our knowlege most, if not all, other software
implementations of this calculation, does not include the effects of
instrumental resolution on the equation above. This means that for data
with very significant resolution smearing (more likely to be encountered
with SANS than with SAXS data) the calculated invariant will be somewhat
high (though in most real cases this will probably not be the dominant
uncertainty).</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The observant reader may notice the lack of a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4 \pi\)</span> prefactor in the
above equation which would be required for an integral over all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> stated
at the beginning. This seems to be the convention historically adopted and
is only important when extracting terms from the invariant as below. As
long as the same convention is applied in their derivation all is consistent.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Also note that if some residual flat background remains in the data, it can
be corrected for if the amount can be estimated as disucussed in the usage
section below.</p>
</div>
<p>In the extreme case of “infinite” slit smearing, the above equation reduces to:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q^* = \Delta q_v \int_0^\infty qI(q)\,dq\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta q_v\)</span> is the slit height, and should be valid as long as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta q_v\)</span> is large enough to include most, if not all, the scattering.
This limit is applicable, for example, to most data taken on Bonse-Hart
type instruments. SasView <em>does</em> implement this limit so that, in contrast to
above, the invariant calculated from such slit-smeared data could be more
accurate than for normal pinhole SANS data which typically has sigificant
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta q / q\)</span>.</p>
<p>The slit smeared expression above has also been used to compute the invariant
from unidirectional cuts through 2D scattering patterns such as, for example,
those arising from oriented fibers (see the Crawshaw<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#crawshaw" id="id4" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> and
Shioya<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#shioya" id="id5" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> references). However, in order to use the Invariant analysis
window to do this, it would first be necessary to put the cuts in a data format
that SasView recognises as slit-smeared by properly including the value of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_v\)</span> in the data file.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Currently SasView will only account for slit smearing if the data being
processed by the Invariant analysis are recognized as slit smeared. It does
not allow for manually inputing a slit value. Currently, only the canSAS
*.XML and NIST *.ABS formats facilitate slit smeared data. The easiest
way to include <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta q_v\)</span> in simple ASCII column data in a way recognizable
by SasView is to mimic the *.ABS format. The data must follow the normal
rules for general ASCII files but include 6 columns. The SasView general
ASCII reader assumes the first four columns are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I(q)\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dI\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma(q)\)</span>.
If the data does not contain any <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dI\)</span> information, these can be faked by
making them ~1% (or less) of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> data. The fourth column <strong>must</strong> contain
the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_v\)</span> value, in Å<sup>-1</sup>, but as a <strong>negative number</strong>. Each row of
data should have the same value. The 5th column <strong>must</strong> be a duplicate of
column 1. <strong>Column 6 can have any value but cannot be empty</strong>. Finally,
the line immediately preceding the actual columnar data <strong>must</strong> begin
with: “The 6 columns”. For an example, see the example data set
1umSlitSmearSphere.ABS in the <em>\test\1d</em> folder).</p>

<section id="data-extrapolation">
<h3>Data Extrapolation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-extrapolation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The difficulty with using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q^*\)</span>  arises from the fact that experimental data is
never measured over the range <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0 \le q \le \infty\)</span> and it is thus usually
necessary to extrapolate the experimental data to both low and high <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>.
Currently, SasView allows extrapolation to any user-defined low and high <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>.
The default range is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-5} \le q \le 10\)</span> Å<sup>-1</sup>. Note that the integrals
above are weighted by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q^2\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>. Thus the high-<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> extrapolation is weighted
far more heavily than the low-<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> extrapolation so that having data measured to
as large a value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_{max}\)</span> as possible can be surprisingly important.</p>
<p>Low-<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> region (&lt;= <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_{min}\)</span> in data):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Guinier function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I_0.exp(-q^2 R_g^2/3)\)</span> can be used, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I_0\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_g\)</span> are obtained by fitting the data within the range <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_{min}\)</span> to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_{min+j}\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> is the user-chosen number of points from which to
extrapolate. The default is the first 10 points. Alternatively a power
law, similar to the high <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> extrapolation, can be used but this is not
recommended!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>High-<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> region (&gt;= <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_{max}\)</span> in data):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The power law function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A/q^m\)</span> is used where the power law constant
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> can be fixed to some value by the user or fit along with the constant
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> will typically be between 3 and 4 for pinhole resolution with
4 indicating sharp interfaces and smaller values more diffuse interfaces.
In real systems this may not always hold of course, but the user should
think about what a deviation means and to what extent it is valid to use
such an extrapolation. The fitted constant(s) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span>) is/are obtained by
fitting the data within the range <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_{max-j}\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_{max}\)</span> where, again,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> is the user chosen number of points from which to extrapolate, the
default again being the last 10 points.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>While the high <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> exponent should generally be close to 4 for a
system with sharp interfaces, in the special case of <em>infinite</em> slit
smearing that power law should be 3 for the same sharp interfaces.</p>

<section id="invariant">
<h3>Invariant<a class="headerlink" href="#invariant" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>SasView implements the invariant calculation for a two-phase (or pseudo
two-phase) system, which represents the most commonly encountered situation.
The invariant for this is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q^* = {2 \pi^2 (\Delta\rho)^2 \phi_1 \phi_2}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\rho = (\rho_1 - \rho_2)\)</span> is the SLD contrast and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_1\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_2\)</span> are the volume fractions of the two phases (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_1 + \phi_2 = 1\)</span>).
Thus from the invariant one can either calculate the volume fractions of the
two phases given the contrast or, calculate the contrast given the volume
fraction. However, the current implementation in SasView only allows for the
former: extracting the volume fraction given a known contrast factor.</p>
</section>
<section id="volume-fraction">
<h3>Volume Fraction<a class="headerlink" href="#volume-fraction" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In some cases, especially in non-particulate systems for which no good
analytical model description exists (as then the scale factor of such a model
would return the volume fraction information), if the contrast term can be
reasonably estimated then the invariant can provide an estimate of the volume
fraction. This is quite common, for example, in the Geosciences and Materials
Science where the amount of porosity in a sample (the second phase) is of
vital interest.</p>
<p>Rearranging the above expression for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q^*\)</span> yields</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\phi_1 \phi_2 = \frac{Q^*}{2 \pi^2 (\Delta\rho)^2} \equiv A\]</div>
<p>and thus, if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_1 &lt; \phi_2\)</span></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}&amp;\phi_1 = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 - 4A}}{2} \\
&amp;\phi_2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1-4A}}{2}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_1\)</span> (the volume fraction of the <em>minority phase</em>) is reported as the
the volume fraction in the Invariant analysis window.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If A&gt;0.25 then the program is obviously unable to compute <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_1\)</span>.
In these circumstances the Invariant window will show the volume fraction
as ERROR. Possible reasons for this are that the contrast has been
incorrectly entered, or that the dataset is simply not suitable for
invariant analysis.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="specific-surface-area">
<h3>Specific Surface Area<a class="headerlink" href="#specific-surface-area" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The total surface area per unit volume is an important quantity for a variety of
applications, for example, to understand the absorption capacity, reactivity, or
catalytic activity of a material. This value, known as the specific surface area
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_v\)</span>, is reflected in the scattering of the material. Indeed, any interfaces in
the material separating regions of different scattering length densities
contribute to the overall scattering.</p>
<p>For a two phase system, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_v\)</span> can be computed from the scattering data as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[S_v = \frac{C_p}{2 \pi (\Delta\rho)^2}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_p\)</span>, the <em>Porod Constant</em>, is given by Porod’s Law:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Cp = \lim_{q \to \infty}I(q) q^4\]</div>
<p>which can be estimated from a Porod model fit to the an appropriately high-<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>
portion of the data or from the intercept of a linear fit to the high-<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>
portion of a Porod Plot: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I(q)*q^4\)</span> vs <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q^4\)</span> (see the Porod model
documentation in the Models Documentation for more details).</p>
<p><strong>This calculation is unrelated to the Invariant</strong> other than to obtain the
contrast term if it is not known (and the volume fraction is known), and depends
only on two values - the contrast and Porod Constant - <em>which must be provided</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="extension-to-three-or-more-phases">
<h3>Extension to Three or More Phases<a class="headerlink" href="#extension-to-three-or-more-phases" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In principle, as suggested in the Introduction, the invariant is a completely
general concept and not limited to two phases.  Extending the formalism to more
phases, so that useful information can be extracted from the invariant
is, however, more difficult.</p>
<p>We note here that in the more generalized formalism the contrast term is
replaced by a quantity called the <em>SLD fluctuation</em>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta\)</span>, so that:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q^* = {2 \pi^2 \langle \eta^2 \rangle}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta\)</span> represents the deviation in SLD from the weighted-average value,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\langle (\rho^*) \rangle\)</span>, at any given point in the system. The mean-square
average of the SLD fluctuations, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(&lt;\eta^2&gt;\)</span>, is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\langle \eta^2 \rangle = \langle (\rho^*)^2 \rangle -
\langle (\rho^*) \rangle^2\]</div>
<p>Returning to the simplest case of a two-phase system, this formalism can be
shown to reduce to the same results given above:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\langle (\rho^*)^2 \rangle = \phi_1 \rho_1^2 + \phi_2 \rho_2^2\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\langle (\rho^*) \rangle = \phi_1 \rho_1 + \phi_2 \rho_2\]</div>
<p>Setting</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\eta_1 = \phi_2 (\rho_1 - \rho_2)\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\eta_2 = \phi_1 (\rho_2 - \rho_1)\]</div>
<p>then yields:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\langle \eta^2 \rangle = \phi_1 \eta_1^2 + \phi_2 \eta_2^2 \equiv \phi_1 \phi_2
(\rho_1 - \rho_2)^2\]</div>
<p>and thus for the two phase system we recover:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q^* = {2 \pi^2 (\Delta\rho)^2 \phi_1 \phi_2}\]</div>

<p>Use the box on the <em>Options</em> tab to specify the contrast term(i.e. difference
