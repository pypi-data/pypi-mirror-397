# XAI Text Classifier

A library to explain whether text is AI-generated or human-written using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

## Features

- **AI vs Human Text Classification**: Distinguish between AI-generated and human-written text
- **Explainability**: Uses SHAP to provide detailed feature importance explanations
- **Multiple Models**: Includes XGBoost and Random Forest models for robust predictions
- **Comprehensive Feature Analysis**: Analyzes 40+ linguistic features including:
  - Readability metrics
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Syntactic complexity
  - Stylistic patterns
  - And more

## Installation

```bash
pip install xai-text-classifier
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd xai-text-classifier
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
from xai import shap_explainer

# Analyze text
text = "Your text here..."
result = shap_explainer(text)

# Returns:
# {
#     "prediction": 0 or 1,  # 0 = Human, 1 = AI
#     "features": {
#         "feature_name": {
#             "value": feature_value,
#             "shap_value": shap_contribution,
#             "importance": relative_importance
#         },
#         ...
#     }
# }
```
