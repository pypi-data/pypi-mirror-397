        """Add inclusion bounds for a given metric of a given component.

        The bounds are used to define the acceptable range of values for a metric
        of a component. The added bounds are kept only temporarily, and removed
        automatically after some expiry time.

        Inclusion bounds give the range that the system will try to keep the
        metric within. If the metric goes outside of these bounds, the system will
        try to bring it back within the bounds.
        If the bounds for a metric are `[[lower_1, upper_1], [lower_2, upper_2]]`,
        then this metric's `value` needs to comply with the constraints `lower_1 <=
        value <= upper_1` OR `lower_2 <= value <= upper_2`.

        If multiple inclusion bounds have been provided for a metric, then the
        overlapping bounds are merged into a single bound, and non-overlapping
        bounds are kept separate.

        Example:
            If the bounds are [[0, 10], [5, 15], [20, 30]], then the resulting bounds
            will be [[0, 15], [20, 30]].

            The following diagram illustrates how bounds are applied:

            ```
              lower_1  upper_1
            <----|========|--------|========|-------->
                                lower_2  upper_2
            ```

            The bounds in this example are `[[lower_1, upper_1], [lower_2, upper_2]]`.

            ```
            ---- values here are considered out of range.
            ==== values here are considered within range.
            ```

        Note:
            For power metrics, regardless of the bounds, 0W is always allowed.

        Args:
            component: The component to add bounds to.
            target: The target metric whose bounds have to be added.
            bounds: The bounds to add to the target metric. Overlapping pairs of bounds
                are merged into a single pair of bounds, and non-overlapping ones are
                kept separated.
            validity: The duration for which the given bounds will stay in effect.
                If `None`, then the bounds will be removed after some default time
                decided by the server, typically 5 seconds.

                The duration for which the bounds are valid. If not provided, the
                bounds are considered to be valid indefinitely.

                if it was not provided by the server.
